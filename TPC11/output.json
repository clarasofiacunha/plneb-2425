                    "Introdução: O nosso objetivo foi estudar a associação entre elevações extremas da velocidade de sedimentação (VS) (>100 mm/h) e a distribuição por categorias de doenças, doenças, idade, sexo, níveis de proteína C-reactiva e sobrevida a 5 anos.",
                    "Métodos: Estudo retrospetivo de todos os doentes com elevação extrema da VS avaliados num hospital português de 1 de Janeiro de 2008 a 31 de Dezembro de 2012. Variáveis independentes incluíram categorias de doenças, subcategorias,idade, sexo e níveis de PCR. A situação vital e data de morte foram determinadas pelo uso do Sistema de Prescrição Eléctrica português.",
                    "Resultados: Uma VS superior a 100 mm/h foi determinada em 681 doentes (1,5% de todas as avaliações de VS). A categoria diagnóstica mais frequente foi infecção (461, 65,1%), seguida de neoplasia (107, 15,1%), e de inflamação/ autoimunidade (85, 12,0%). A doença mais prevalente foi a pneumonia (227, 33,3% de todos os doentes). A infeção era menos provável nos doentes de ambulatório (20,7%), assim como a neoplasia em mulheres (11,4%). A mortalidade a cinco anos foi de 70,3%, superior nos doentes com neoplasia (83%) e inferior nos doentes com inflamação/autoimunidade (45,9%).",
                    "Conclusão: Verificámos que quase todos os doentes com elevação extrema da VS têm uma etiologia identificável, com infecção a ser a causa em cerca de dois terços e a pneumonia a ser responsável em cerca de um terço de todos os doentes. A infecção foi menos provável em doentes de ambulatório, assim como a neoplasia em mulheres. Os níveis de VS e de PCR têm fraca correlação nestes doentes. A mortalidade a cinco anos foi de 70,3%, com a sobrevida a ser significativamente menor em doentes com neoplasia, e superior em doentes com inflamação/autoimunidade. Estes resultados poderão auxiliar à avaliação diagnóstica e prognóstica dos doentes com elevações extremas da VS."

Recentemente, tem sido proposta a abordagem de múltiplos treatable traits no tratamento da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica. Apesar da evidência da relação fisiopatológica entre as duas doenças, a literaturarelativa à diabetes mellitus como treatable trait da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica é escassa.",
                    "Métodos: Realizou-se um estudo de coorte retrospetivo, que incluiu indivíduos com doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica, seguidos na Consulta Externa de Medicina Interna de um hospital universitário. Foram avaliados a presença de diabetes mellitus, o controlo glicémico e os outcomes da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica.",
                    "Resultados: Foram incluídos 279 doentes. A maioria (76,3%) era do sexo masculino, com média etária de 71,1 ± 9,5 anos. A prevalência da diabetes mellitus foi 30,8%. A maioria dos doentes diabéticos (54,7%) apresentou bom controlo glicémico (HbA1c < 7%). A mediana de HbA1c foi 6,7% [1,0]. Não se verificou uma diferença estatisticamente significativa entre diabéticos e não diabéticos relativamente ao estadio da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica, risco de exacerbação aguda de doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica a um ano, tempo de internamento por exacerbação aguda ou mortalidade a um ano.",
                    "Conclusão: A prevalência e a incidência de diabetes mellitus nos doentes com doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica foram superiores em relação à população geral. Nesta população, verificou-se um bom controlo glicémico na maioria dos doentes e a diabetes não se associou a outcomes adversos na doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica. A diabetes deve ser considerada como treatable trait da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica e o controlo glicémico deve ser um alvo terapêutico. A consulta externa de Medicina Interna desempenha um importante papel na abordagem integradora de que o doentecom doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica beneficia."

Identificaram-se 426 internamentos por IC, 17305 consultas médicas de cuidados de saúde primários, 857episódios de urgência e 6707 consultas médicas hospitalares. O custo direto total foi €4 089 540,10. O custo em cuidados hospitalares (CH) foi a principal rubrica de custos (56%), seguido dos cuidados de saúde primários (23%) e consumo de medicamentos (20%). O custo médio anual por doente foi €987,81.",
                    "Conclusão: O custo direto total corresponde a 0,1% doproduto interno bruto da RAM e 1,2% da despesa da saúdeda RAM para o ano de referência. Estes resultados fornecem informação até aqui desconhecida e poderão auxiliar na implementação de modelos e estruturas que promovam a redução das hospitalizações, principal motor de custos diretos."

Contudo, a falta de evidência científica leva a que o seu tratamento seja bastante controverso, tornando imperativa a realização de mais estudos. Este estudo pretende avaliar a eficácia e a segurança das várias estratégias terapêuticasutilizadas na ateromatose complexa da aorta.",
                    "Material e Métodos: Foi realizada uma análise retrospetivados doentes internados por AVC isquémico com diagnóstico de ateromatose complexa da aorta por ecocardiograma transesofágico, entre 1 de janeiro de 2010 e 31 de dezembro de 2022.",
                    "Resultados: Dos 82 doentes incluídos, 23,2% apresentaramrecorrência de AVC isquémico, dos quais 47,4% estavammedicados com clopidogrel em monoterapia. Os doentes medicados com clopidogrel apresentaram maior recorrência de AVC isquémico (p <0,001), enquanto doentesmedicados com dupla antiagregação apresentaram menor recorrência (p = 0,035). Doentes medicados com anticoagulantes orais diretos não apresentaram recorrência. Dos doentes medicados com varfarina, cinco tiveram recorrência com INR infra-terapêutico e dois apresentaram eventos hemorrágicos.",

Nos doentes com indicação para anticoagulação os anticoagulantes orais diretos pareceram ser eficazes e mais seguros do que a varfarina."

                    "Introdução: A gestão do Serviço de Urgência Geral (SUG) é complexa e multifatorial, com um influxo crescente de utentes, levando a sobrelotação hospitalar, com maiores tempos de espera, desgaste profissional e menor qualidade de cuidados. Cerca de 43% dos casos em Portugal são classificados como admissões não urgentes e pouco urgentes.",
                    "Métodos: Este estudo observacional retrospetivo foi realizado no SUG de um hospital distrital de Portugal, de outubro de 2018 a maio de 2019. Foram incluídos adultos com prioridade verde e azul na triagem. O destino na alta e o número de admissões à urgência foram analisados, com associações examinadas em relação à idade, modo de proveniência, ativação de via azul e acesso a cuidados de saúde primários.",
                    "Resultados: Incluímos 41 066 episódios, a maioria deles com prioridade verde (99,9%). A maioria dos doentes, 98,8%, teve alta para cuidados ambulatórios. Os frequent flyers (≥ 4 admissões) constituíam 3,3% dos doentes e os high users (≥ 10admissões) 0,3%. A análise mostrou associações significativas entre o destino à data de alta com a idade, com a proveniência e com a ativação da via azul (p <0,001). Houve ainda uma associação estatisticamente muito significativa entre o número de admissões e a idade (p <0,001) e o número de admissões e a capacidade de acesso aos CSP (p <0,001).",
                    "Conclusão: O estudo destaca a importância de vários fatores no destino dos doentes, mostrando uma forte associação entre a idade e a probabilidade de internamento. Além disso, a forma de chegada ao SUG e a ativação da via azul também se associam com o destino do doente. No entanto, são necessários mais estudos para entender os problemas sistémicos do SUG."

Ocorre uma absorção descontrolada do ferro e risco de sobrecarga a nível do fígado, coração, pâncreas, articulações e órgãos endócrinos. Os doentes estão em risco de evolução para cirrose e carcinoma hepático. Deve ser suspeitada na presença de sintomas, história familiar ou elevação dos marcadores séricos do ferro, em especial da saturação da transferrina. O diagnóstico é desafiante pela inespecificidade de manifestações clínicas e dos marcadores séricos do ferro. Há vários genes implicados,mas o HFE é o mais frequentemente afetado; a homozigotia C282Y associada a sobrecarga de ferro faz diagnóstico; outras variantes genéticas podem necessitar de estudo complementar com ressonância magnética ou biópsia hepática. O tratamento preferencial é a flebotomia, ou, em alternativa, eritrocitaferese ou quelação do ferro. Apresentam elevada morbimortalidade que pode ser reduzida com o início atempado do tratamento."

                    "This text explores two life paths that crossed under the sign of rattlesnake root, a native plant commonly used by the Seneca in Virginia but only discovered and applied in European-origin medicine in the second half of the 18th century. John Tennent and João de Sequeira shared their European roots, the influence of boerhaavian medicine on their medicalpractice and the enthusiasm for the therapeutic properties of rattlesnake root. Tennent, on settling in Virginia, learnt how the Seneca used this root to cure rattlesnake bites and used it to treat respiratory diseases, particularly pleurisy and pneumonia; amazed with the good results, he disseminated his discovery in America and Europe, although generating some controversy in the medical community. Sequeira, a doctor with family origins in Brazil and a childhood marked by inquisitorial harassment, studied medicine in Leiden under the influence of the boerhaavian school; he ended up moving to Williamsburg, where he began to use rattlesnake root as an essential element in his daily medical practice, as he made clear in his notes on the diseases prevalent in Virginia. The focus on the properties of this plant in the treatment of a variety of pathologies is indicative of the valorization of indigenous medicine and the search for innovative therapeutic treatments at the time."

                    "Methods: This prospective observational study began during the first phase of the pandemic in Portugal and sought to follow patients hospitalized with COVID-19 for two years after discharge, analyzing potential pulmonary sequelae. To date, there have been no similar studies in Portugal.",
                    "Results: The study included 36 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between 1 March and 30 June 2020. Dyspnea was found to be the most prevalent and persistent respiratory symptom during follow-up. Regarding computed tomography changes, the most frequently described were ground glass and fibrotic changes, with improvement over one year of follow-up less evident in the case of fibrotic changes. Of particular note was the diagnosis of a case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with COVID-19, a rare entity, but one that has already been described in the literature. Changes in echocardiograms or respiratory function tests were rarely documented.",
                    "Conclusion: Given the small sample size, further prospective studies will be needed to clarify. The results reflect the difficulties encountered in carrying out research during the pandemic period, which conditioned the design and realization of the study, but which will certainly serve as an example and support in similar crises in the future."

                    "Introduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionized the treatment of various medical conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. Due to their affordability, widespread availability, and favourable safety profile, they are among the most commonly prescribed medications today. However, they are often prescribed without a valid medical reason, a practice that can be observed in up to 80% of cases.",
                    "Methods: A retrospective study was conducted with theprimary objective of assessing the proportion of patients onPPIs and the presence or absence of a valid indication for their use. Additionally, we examined whether PPI usage had any impact on hospitalization duration and mortality. Finally, a brief cost analysis of these medications was performed. The study was carried out using a sample of patients admitted to a tertiary university hospital over nine months in internal medicine wards. Electronic records were consulted to collect pertinent information.",
                    "Results: A total of 164 patients, with an average age of82.7 ± 10.6 years, were assessed. The mean length of hospitalization was 12.7 ± 10.0 days. Approximately 61% of patients on PPIs lacked a valid indication for their use, whileapproximately one-fifth of patients not on PPIs had a validindication. In both patient groups, the most common indication for PPI usage was prophylaxis in high-risk patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). PPIs did not demonstrate any influence on the length of hospitalization or mortality. On average, each patient on PPIs spent €25.8 per year, contributing to an unnecessary total public funds expenditure of €679.1 in the assessed sample.",
                    "Conclusion: Considering the advanced age of the individuals, many of them were taking NSAIDs or antiplatelet agents, which is likely the reason for PPI prescription even in the absence of a valid indication. Various efforts have been made to implement measures to reverse this prescribing trend, with some showing effectiveness, notably educational outreach visits."

Although most cases are sporadic, outbreaks of food origin have been reported. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is diverse, particularly bacteriemia, sepsis, and central nervous system (CNS) infection. It mainly affects elderly patients with important comorbidities or immunosuppression states, and pregnant women. Mortality can reach 30%.",
                    "Material and Methods: We selected the specimens positive for strains of Listeria spp. using the laboratory informatic system database of our hospital center from 2013-2020. The patients’ corresponding processes were reviewed for demographic variables and clinical data as predisposing conditions, type of infection and outcome.",
                    "Results: Twenty-five cases of Listeria infection were identified, with a mean age of 66.6 years. Most individuals (92%) had some risk factor or predisposing condition, with the most frequent being age > 65 years (64%), followed by the use of proton pump inhibitors, diabetes, alcoholism, neoplasia, and immunosuppressive therapy. Nineteen cases of bacteriemia and 9 cases of CNS infection were observed, and focal forms such as endocarditis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and infected muscle hematoma were observed. Overall mortality was 16%. No patient with CNS infection has died. Only in one case was there a relationship with a possible food outbreak.",
                    "Conclusion: In our series, we found data similar to those in the literature, but we highlight the high percentage of patients with multiple predisposing conditions, less common focal forms, and the absence of mortality in patients with CNS infection. The analysis of our data allowed us to understand the importance of clarifying the source of infection, which is why we advise the use of a questionnaire regarding the consumption of suspicious food or an outbreak of food origin."

Severe hyperkalemia increases the risk of cardiac disturbances and mortality. Real-world studies and international expert groups highlight the urgent need to optimize hyperkalemia management however, consensus in this area is lacking, especially concerning new drugs. We aim to establish a consensus among healthcare professionals in Portugal regarding the effective management of HK in emergency settings. Additionally, we aim to provide recommendations for the adoption of best practices in emergency care.",
                    "Methods: This qualitative study was based on Delphiconsensus. A panel of experts collaboratively identified anddiscussed five main topics related to HK management anddefined 25 treatment statements. An online questionnaire was distributed to doctors who frequently handle emergencies between July and August 2023. A consensus was defined when at least 65% of respondents indicated agreement or strong agreement with a statement. The initial round produced high agreement levels, obviating the need for additional survey rounds.",
                    "Results: A total of 63 specialist doctors participated in the online questionnaire. There was a very high consensus,with over 90% of participants either agreeing or stronglyagreeing with 19 of the 25 statements. These establish thatHK is a critical concern for patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those with a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), elderly population and patients on medications such as inhibitor renin-angiotensin–aldosterone system (iRAAS), angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs), mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs), or potassium-sparing diuretics. They also agree that HK is associated with higher mortality risk, which increases in individuals with underlying conditions or prolonged HK. Statements regarding potassium management involving sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), patiromer, scavengers in patients on iRAAS, and related to insulin treatment had the lowest consensus levels.",
                    "Conclusion: A robust consensus among Portuguesehealthcare professionals regarding effective HK management in emergency settings was achieved. Experts collaboratively formulated recommendations covering key aspects of the management of HK in emergency settings. Implementing these recommendations will enhance the delivery of harmonized evidence-based medical care and the improvement of clinical outcomes."

The authors present the case of a 71-year-old diabetic woman who developed gastrointestinal symptoms one month after increasing the dose of dapagliflozin. Liver enzyme elevation was observed, without evidence of obstructive causes on imaging exams. Other causes of liver disease were excluded, and liver biopsy favored a toxic/drug etiology. Liver enzyme normalization was observed after discontinuation of dapagliflozin. Liver injury associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is very rare, and the authors aim to raise awareness about the potential hepatotoxic effects of dapagliflozin, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

The prevalence has been increasing in recent years, currently affecting around 25% of the world's population. The hallmark of its pathophysiology lies in insulin resistance and the accumulation of fat inside hepatocytes. Several clinical scores allow cost-effective screening, such as FIB-4 and NFS. Although it is considered the gold standard, liver biopsy can often be avoided by using hepatic elastography. Numerous drugs used in diabetes have therapeutic potential in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, with the most studied class being GLP-1 receptor agonists. The bidirectional pathophysiological association between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and diabetes will enable the development of this field and the emergence of new therapies"

                    "Introduction: Healthcare professionals often contend with significant emotional burdens in their work, including the impact of negative emotions, such as stress and anxiety, which can have profound consequences on immediate and long-term healthcare delivery. In this paper a stress estimation algorithm is proposed based on the classification of negative valence emotions in speech recordings.",
                    "Methods: An end-to-end machine learning pipeline is proposed. Two distinct decision models are considered, VGG-16 and SqueezeNet, while sharing a common constant Q power spectrogram input for acoustic representation. The system is trained and evaluated using the RAVDESS and TESS emotional speech datasets.",
                    "Results: The system was evaluated for individual emotionclassification (multiclass problem) and also for negative andneutral or positive emotion classification (binary problem). The results achieved are comparable to previously reported systems, with the SqueezeNet model offering a significantly smaller footprint, enabling versatile applications. Further exploration of the model's parameter space holds promise for enhanced performance.",
                    "Conclusion: The proposed system can constitute a feasibleapproach for the estimation of a low-cost non-invasive biomarker for negative emotions. This allows to raise alerts and develop mitigating actions to the burden of negative emotions, being an additional management tool for healthcare services that allows to maintain quality and maximize availability."

                    "Artificial intelligence (AI) and its many aliases, including machine learning, deep learning and big data, have invaded modern medicine impacting most aspects of modern practice. One of the most controversial and potentially impactful, is artificial intelligence use in medical imaging. While most commercial and academic attention has focused on higher cost imaging modalities such as magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), ultrasound has also become the target of AI application developers. Ultrasound presents additional barriers to AI application development and execution, not seen in axial imaging such as MRI and CT. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), with its lack of standardization and plethora of inexperienced users, poses the greatest imaging challenge to AI. However, POCUS is also the key to widespread access to diagnostic and interventional ultrasound at the patient’s bedside throughout the world. This article discusses AI, it utilization in POCUS, current challenges, risks, limitations, needs and future possibilities."

Rather than being seen as unsolvable obstacles, these challenges can be perceived as powerful stimuli, encouraging the search for innovative and creative solutions, especially in a context where new digital technologies applicable to healthcare are emerging. In the context of this article, which shares a transformative visionof healthcare provision, we describe a pilot program developed for the Heart Failure ambulatory of the Internal Medicine Department at the Braga Local Health Unit (ULS-Braga). This proposal encompasses not only treatment, but also proactive health promotion, based on an approach that incorporates cutting-edge digital technology. The overall aim is to significantly expand the scope of outpatient services and provide innovative home care, bringing it closer to the specific needs of (healthy and sick) individuals."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed cases of diabetes and pre-diabetes among patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward, thereby assessing the relevance of routinely conducting glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) determinations for all admitted patients.",
                    "Material and Methods: In this descriptive observationalcross-sectional study, patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward over a 15-week period were analyzed. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: a prior diagnosis of diabetes, the presence of pathologies or conditions that could interfere with HbA1c measurements, or if screening would not be beneficial due to clinical or ethical considerations. After identifying eligible patients, HbA1c levels were determined, and patients were categorized as “Without Diabetes”, “Pre-Diabetes” or “Diabetes”, with corresponding prevalence rates calculated.",

Direct oral anticoagulants quantification was performed mainly due to hemorrhagic events and need for urgent invasive technical procedures. At admission, most patients had direct oral anticoagulants concentrations > 50 ng/mL and more than half had their anticoagulation suspended at discharge (pending further evaluation in an outpatient setting). 26% did prothrombin complex and 5% did Idarucizumab, due to clinical severity.

Creating Emergency Department protocols, accessible to all specialties, regarding direct oral anticoagulants quantification and its main indications, should be a priority in anticoagulation management, guiding clinical decisions and reducing duration of hospital stay, comorbidities and mortality."

No other professionals, healthcare settings, or testing technologies are included, despite innovations toward more patient-centric care.",
                    "Methods: We performed a focused review of literaturepublished between 2011 and 2021 regarding reflex (in which confirmation of antibody-positive test is done on the initial serum specimen) or single-step testing, HCV core antigen (cAg), and point-of-care (POC) HCV NAAT.",
                    "Results: We incorporated a total of 44 relevant papers,mostly from Spain and the United States of America.",
                    "Discussion: Reflex testing workflows have consistentlybeen shown to increase completion of confirmatory testing,screening program cost-effectiveness, patient linkageto care, and treatment initiation. HCV cAg determinationhas also been established as an acceptable alternative toNAAT for confirmatory testing, with lower cost and lowerturnaround time (70% and 85% respectively). Lastly, POCHCV NAAT enables decentralized screening in communitysettings, with minimal infrastructure and technical expertiserequired. Although concerns remain regarding the cost ofPOC NAAT solutions, their availability is crucial in empowering facilities caring for at-risk populations to perform timely confirmatory testing and increase patient linkage to care and treatment.",
                    "Conclusion: There is a strong body of evidence to supportreflex testing as the standard of care for HCV screeningin all healthcare settings. HCV cAg or POC HCV NAATconfirmatory testing should also be supported where appropriate, in alternative to strictly central laboratory-based HCV NAAT."

                    "A literature review was carried out with the aim of disseminating existing scientific evidence and increasing the degree of clinical suspicion of the medical community.",
                    "Currently, many mutations associated with this syndromehave been identified, causing defects in the ubiquitylationand activation of the innate immune system. From thephenotypic analyses of the mutation carriers, some common features were found: male, over 50 years old, cytopenias, fever and constitutional symptoms, and all organs and systems with variable manifestations and proportions may be involved. The inflammatory and multi-systemic nature of this disease leads to a diagnostic and treatment challenge, adding to the already existing high morbimortality. Presently, the treatments with greater efficiency are corticosteroid therapy, azacytidine, JAK-1/2 inhibitors and interleukin-6 inhibitors. There are also benefits in autologous stem cell transplants.",

The development and progression of ASCVD are closely related to hypercholesterolaemia, with high LDL-C levels being its most important and easily modifiable risk factor. Reducing LDL-C has been shown to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events and European recommendations advocate LDL-C target values according to the patient's cardiovascular risk. The risk of hypercholesterolaemia is cumulative, making it relevant to reduce LDL-C as early as possible.",

The advantage of its long duration of action will potentially overcome the low compliance of patients to treatment and increase the effectiveness in reducing LDL-C, which may translate into a reduction in morbidity and mortality from ASCVD and its high economic impact."

The aim of this work is to characterize the population followed by a palliative care team, both in-hospital and at home, to assess the prevalence of delirium, the therapeutic strategy, its resolution, and the factors associated with the higher or lower prevalence of delirium.",
                    "Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out, including all patients followed in the hospital and at home by a palliative care team in Portugal during the year of 2019.",

                    "Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus. It is a high-incidence disease, associated with great morbidity, which might create or worsen a patient’s frailty condition, thus reinforcing the importance of vaccination. Among the risk factors for HZ infection and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), its major complication, are age, immunosuppression and the presence ofchronic conditions. Vaccination is an efficacious strategy to prevent HZ and PHN. In Portugal, there are two available HZ vaccines: the live attenuated vaccine and the recombinant vaccine, which demonstrated a high efficacy against HZ and its complications, particularly in the populations with higher risk, immunosuppressed and with immunosenescence for whom live attenuated vaccine is contraindicated. Notwithstanding, the HZ vaccine is not included in the National Vaccination Program and there are not specific national recommendations for immunization. Hence, the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine and the Portuguese Association of General and Family Medicine elaborated a consensus report establishing guidelines for HZ vaccination.",
                    "Vaccination against HZ is recommended for all adults aged 50 years and over, as well as for adults aged between 18 and 49 years at high risk for HZ, namely patients with comorbidities or immunosuppression. Immunocompetent adults should be preferentially immunized with the recombinant vaccine, although they might receive the live attenuated vaccine in punctual situations; immunocompromised adults should only be immunized with the recombinant vaccine. The vaccination of individuals with a previous HZ episode is recommended, and individuals with prior immunization with the live attenuated vaccine should receive the recombinant vaccine. Promoting patient’s literacy when prescribing HZ vaccine is highly relevant, and the physician should have an active role in raising awareness about the importance of shingles vaccination."

                    "Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Nonetheless, the underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. Certain factors have shown association with increased risk, but there is still data lacking. The main objective of this study was to identify factors associated with AKI in CAP.",
                    "Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with confirmed CAP, admitted to an Internal Medicine department within a period of 1 year, presenting with or without AKI on admission. We performed comparative statistics between non-AKI and AKI patients, univariate and multivariable logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) calculation, and survival analysis.",
                    "Results: This study included 578 patients, of which 52.4% were male, had a mean age of 81.70±11.54 years, and 41.3% had AKI. The mean age was higher in the AKI group (p<0.001), with no differences for gender. In the univariate analysis, several comorbidities, drugs, diastolic blood pressure and some gasometric parameters showed association with AKI. The multivariable analysis selected seven variables as independent associated factors: age (OR 1.027), hyperuricemia (OR 1.990), chronic kidney disease (OR 3.138), diuretic (OR 1.555), statin (OR 1.805), diastolic blood pressure (OR 0.978) and serum lactate (OR 1.350), enabling the development of an AKI probabilistic model with a specificity of 81.1%.",
                    "Conclusion: This study confirmed previous findings and identified new factors associated with AKI, namely serum lactate. The multivariable model represents a starting point for the creation of true predictive indexes of AKI in CAP with clinical applicability and impact on the therapeutic approach and prognosis."

                    "Results: In 2019 the HGO’s IM service admitted 2841 patients: 532 (18.7%) were less than 65 years old and 2309 (81.3%) were 65 years old or older. In the statistical analyses 2133 patients were included, with a mean age of 80.0 ± 7.8 years. Female gender represented 54.7% of the sample size. Mean number of comorbidities per patient was 6.1 ± 2.8, and 54.8% were considered frail. Frail patients were at higher risk of death in hospital (RR = 3.1) and after discharge (RR = 2), even after adjustment for confounders.",
                    "Conclusion: The population admitted to IM services is mainly elderly with variable degrees of multimorbidity and frailty. frailty seems to be a major predictor of readmission and death in this population. Given the heterogenicity of this age group, multidimensional evaluations and individualized care plans are mandatory. It is urgent that Portuguese IM services adapt to the care of elderly patients, with a strong investment in interdisciplinary care focused on quality of life. Education in geriatric medicine should be a priority to IM teams."

It is necessary to know what they think and consider to be their information and training needs.",

The clinical conditions susceptible to access to the procedure are not of clear meaning for more than 70% of the respondents, according to the terms defined in the law: “definitive injury of extreme gravity”, “serious or incurable injury” and “suffering of great intensity”. Less than 16% consider that Portugal offers good end-of-life care and that the request for death provoked at one's own request does not constitute a priority criterion for access to Palliative Care.",

Spontaneous viral clearance of HCV, defined by sustained undetectable serum viral load concentrations, occurs in about 20%-25% of those infected, usually within the first 6 to 12 months after primary infection. We present the case of a patient admitted to an internal medicine ward with a likely chronic HCV infection, without epidemiological context, but with established liver disease and cirrhosis, who developed a process of spontaneous elimination, due to acute Epstein Barr virus infection."

It is estimated that malnutrition affects one in three elderly people at home and one in three patients in elderly care institutions. Malnutrition is reversible as long as the patient has access to timely nutritional screening that identifies their nutritional risk and as long as an individualized nutritional intervention is instituted. Disease associated malnutrition continues to be perceived as a secondary problem in primary health care, so the implementation of nutritional risk screening, as a routine parameter, is the first step in improving access to nutritional care in the community. In this article, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool is proposed for routine nutritional screening in primary care."

There were 65.5% (n = 845) of patients with hypertension, 54.9% (n = 709) dyslipidemia and about a third had diabetes mellitus and obesity (31 and 38%, respectively). Comparatively to the non-hypertensive patients, hypertensive group presented with higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia (p <0.001)) and lower functionality and more comorbidities (as calculated by AVDezIS and Charlson modified scores, p<0.001). There was also higher proportion of severe COVID-19 disease (p = 0.003), greater number of patients admitted to intensive care units (p <0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (p <0.001).

Depending on age, comorbidities, co-ingestion of other medications and the magnitude of toxic ingestion, clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to shock. High dose insulin seems to be an effective adjunctive therapy, despite the lack of randomized studies. We report a series of cases of calcium channel blockers voluntary intoxication with clinical improvement after treatment with high dose insulin. Patients were young and without major comorbidities. Amlodipine was the drug used and, in two cases, there was co-ingestion of other drugs. At admission, despite volume replacement, all patients had persistent hypotension requiring vasopressor support. High dose insulin perfusion was started early, with a mean infusion of 0.67 U/kg/h, which allowed a sustained reduction in vasopressor dose. Hypokalemia and hypoglycemia were frequent, but without severity. In conclusion, it is essential that health professionals know how to recognize and manage these clinical situations given its high risk of mortality. High dose insulin seems to be a viable and safe therapy in these patients as long as intensive monitoring is guaranteed."

Thus, the authors present a case report of erythroderma in a 65-year-old woman, who developed intense pruritus associated with erythroderma for about 2 weeks, with an associated fever peak. She had a previous clinical history of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with long-term use of immunosuppressants and systemic corticosteroids. Evaluated by dermatologists who, through direct examination by skin scraping and skin biopsy, confirmed the diagnosis of crusted scabies.

This often complica its clinical diagnosis, especially in early stages, hampers its study and understanding and prevents appropriate treatment to be given in due time, in numerous situations. Furthermore, it hinders clinical research for a better understanding of the syndrome and its treatment, in different homogeneous groups of patients with RF. Clinical practice demonstrates that we have an incomplete knowledge of RF, its diagnostic approach, management and treatment. RF directly impacts patient’s quality of life and prognosis. It should be considered a nosologic entity, with unique clinical, physiopathological and dynamic characteristics, that demands a dedicated investigation aiming to be better understood and treated with the goal of changing its course and improve clinical outcomes."

Supplementary oxygen therapy plays an important role on that. In the last years, the use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) in palliative care has been developed. We present three cases of patients accompanied by the Palliative Care Team who used HFNC for dyspnoea control and the team’s effort for organizing domiciliary use of it. All patients showed a better quality of life, in what concerns dyspnoea, and the use of opioid therapy was reduced. The presence of the Palliative Care Team was essential for the patient, family and domiciliary care team’s support. HFNC seems to be a possible secure and effective resource in the management of respiratory symptoms in the palliative patient, along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies."

In February 2021, the first cases of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis at uncommon sites (cerebral venous sinus and splanchnic venous thrombosis) induced by the vaccines were described. The incidence is still unknown, but early studies in the USA suggest an incidence of 1 in 533 333/vaccinated individuals, and this is probably underestimated.

Haematological abnormalities are uncommon, and most frequently include lymphopenia and anaemia. Thrombocytopenia, however, is rare, and three distinct pathophysiological mechanisms have been described: immune platelet destruction, splenomegaly with hypersplenism, and bone marrow infiltration. We report a case of sarcoidosis presenting with pulmonary and cutaneous involvement, and severe acute thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate was consistent with an immune process, assumed as the primary cause for the cytopenia, but bone marrow biopsy also showed multiple noncaseating granulomas, and a CT scan revealed massive splenomegaly. There are no guidelines for the management of thrombocytopenia in sarcoidosis. In our patient, treatment with intravenous immune globulin and corticosteroids restored normal platelet count."

                    "Introduction: The Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is of great potential value in the emergency department (ED). However, there is still uncertainty about its diagnostic accuracy and reliability, with studies warranting larger cohorts. In one of the largest and most heterogeneous cohorts considered to date, the aim was to vali[1]date and explore the applicability of the CAM-ICU (European Portuguese) as a delirium screening and diagnostic tool in the ED setting of a main hospital referral centre.",
                    "Methods: Data were randomly and prospectively recorded in a convenience sample of patients with 18 years or older admitted to the ED of Hospital de Braga (Braga, Portugal). Delirium status was primarily assessed using the CAM- -ICU. For the validation aspect, the reference standard was a psychiatric evaluation, conducted within 3 hours of the CAM- -ICU by a psychiatrist blind to the finding, using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, without external interference on the regular proceedings in the ED on the timing, number and operationalization of psychiatric evaluations in the setting.",
                    "Results: After exclusion/inclusion criteria, of the 592 patients evaluated, 19.8% were diagnosed with delirium using the CAM-ICU. The reference standard was applied to 81 patients. The CAM-ICU presented a sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI= 74.1 to 99.8) and specificity of 88.3% (95% CI= 76.8 to 94.8). CAM-ICU showed an accuracy of 90.1% with the reference standard.",
                    "Conclusion: The CAM-ICU (Portuguese version) is practical, valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of delirium in the real setting of an ED showing sensibility, specificity and accuracy for delirium diagnosis."

Although thrombotic manifestations are common, clinically significant cerebral arterial ischemia is rarely reported. We report the case of an 80-year-old man admitted for multifocal stroke, altered coagulation tests, and worsening renal function. After extensive investigation, the diagnosis of multisystem thrombosis in the context of chronic DIC was assumed. A lymph node biopsy documented lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. Therapeutic enoxaparin was started but the patient rapidly deteriorated and died. Thrombotic microangiopathies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of stroke, especially if multifocal and associated with ischemic manifestations in other organs. Chronic DIC can be secondary to mucin-producing solid adenocarcinomas and has been increasingly reported in stage IV lung cancer. The overall prognosis is poor, and anticoagulation is insufficient in the absence of treatment of the underlying disease."

The oral route is the preferred therapeutic route in palliative care, however, there are situations in which its use is not possible. Thus, it becomes important to have alternative therapeutic routes to fulfill the objective of keeping the patient comfortable at home.

Clinicians have a variety of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions available. This article aims to review the different therapeutic options. In the treatment of insomnia in hospitalized elderly patients, priority should be given to non-pharmacological measures that will improve sleep quality and improve well-being and health recovery. Some measures can be applied duringthe day, such as minimizing daytime naps, preventing and treating delirium as well as looking for and treat undiagnosed sleeping disorders.",
                    "Regarding the pharmacological measures, more than emphasize the less harmful medicines, we intend to reinforce medicines to be avoided due to side effects and impact on patients’ comorbidities, like benzodiazepines with a long half-life and antihistamines. Other drugs to consider in clinical practice are non-benzodiazepine drugs such as zolpidem and antidepressants with sedative effects such as mirtazapine and trazodone"

This clinician worked in Brazil, Angola andPortugal at the end of the 18th century and the beginningof the 19th century and left a valuable medical legacy lyingdormant for more than two hundred years in national libraries and archives. With the support of the GulbenkianFoundation and the work of a large luso-brazilian team, fourvolumes have now been recovered and published, allowingthe dissemination of his remarkable work. It follows the movement described at the same time by Michel Foucault in hisseminal work, “Naissance de la Clinique” as the emergence of Modern Medicine. Presented and disseminated at Conferences and Symposia in the Literature and History circles,it is only right that this work should be made known to thewider medical community. Pioneer in its time in many aspects, in addition to the beauty and clarity of its prose, itmaintains a surprising relevance for the new medical generations and in particular for internists."

                    "Results: We present a case series from 5 (female) patients with GD subtype 1 from a single institution, who were treated with ERT. The age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 35 years. Three patients have histological diagnoses and 2 enzymatic diagnoses. All were medicated with ERT (4 imiglucerase, 1 velaglucerase), and 3 were previously medicated with alglucerase. The age at onset of ERT ranged between 26 and 52 years-old. Prior to ERT, 80% had thrombocytopenia, 100% anaemia, 40% splenomegaly (although the remaining 60% were previously splenectomised), 100% hepatomegaly and 80% bone pain. After 6 months of treatment, there was a reduction in the volume of the spleen and liver, improvement of anaemia and thrombocytopenia and improved bone pain. There was also a reduction in the levels of β-D-chitotriosidase and tartar resistant acid phosphatase.",

The aim of this study is to assess the length of hospital stay and medical complications of patients referred to the network in the same period of four different years. Material and Methods: Observational, retrospective study of medical patients with medical conditions referred from the hospital in the months of April to June 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2019. Demographic, clinical and referral data were obtained from clinical processes. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics®, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: 205 patients were included. The main reasons for admission were infection (37.1%) and acute cerebrovascular event (35.6%) and for referral was functional rehabilitation (79.5%). There was an increase in length of stay over the years (p < 0.001) and from referral to hospital discharge, p = 0.04. After clinical discharge, 42.9% developed medical complications and after hospital discharge, at least 31.3% needed to be readmitted within 3 months. The number of complications did not rise.Discussion: The increase in hospital stays over the years since the creation of the network implies an overload in hospital health care, even though there is no increase in clinical complications before and after discharge. Conclusion: There is a clear need to strengthen the network and social support to the chronically ill and to create studies to assess the economic and health impact of hospital referrals."

The clinical picture tended to be nonspecific, with headache as the most frequent manifestation. In case of clinical suspicion, a negative head CT does not exclude the diagnosis and the investigation should be continued with MR and MRA.

Its management involves a multidisciplinary approach. The authors intend to describe the characteristics of an adult population with OI and evaluate the treatment used.",

Data were recorded from the medical history reported by the patients, physical examination, radiological, laboratory and bone densitometry data as well as used treatment.",
                    "Results: Twenty patients were included aged between 19 and 61 years old, 75.0% of them were classified type I OI, 15.0% type III and 10,0% type IV. The mean number of fractures were 15.45 ± 15.39 and this number was higher in type III and IV patients. Regarding bone mineral density, 50.0% of patients under 50 years old and 100.0% of patients older than 50 years presented osteoporosis criteria, as well as 66.6% and 50.0% of type III and IV patients, respectively. About 90.0% of patients reported being treated with bisphosphonates at some point in their lives.",

It can be caused by a broad spectrum of diseases with very different prognostic outcomes. Constant re-evaluation of clinical data is essential considering the dynamic changes in disease patterns. We aim to understand which clinical approach is most commonly used and recognize our local epidemiology in order to improve the diagnostic approach to these patients.",
                    "Methods: We performed a retrospective study in an internal medicine department of a public tertiary hospital. Clinical records of all patients admitted during 2016 and 2017 were onsulted; data from patients that fulfilled FUO criteria were collected.",

Infections were the most frequent cause (n = 23; 41.8%) followed by non-infectious inflammatory diseases (n = 12; 21.8%), malignancies (n = 8; 14.5%) and miscellaneous group (n = 3; 5.5%). However, in 9 cases (16.4%) the etiology remained unknown. The most common disease causing FUO was Q fever, followed by infective bacterial endocarditis and abscesses in different locations. Microbiological study of urine and blood was performed in all patients, while serological tests showed wider variability. The use of 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) in 11 (20.0%) cases stands out.",
                    "Conclusion: FUO etiologies in our cohort were comparable to other published studies despite the smaller sample. Infections were the most frequent cause identified. Though a significant number of cases remained unknown, it carried a good prognosis."

                    "Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled adult patients admitted in the intensive care unit between January and March 2020. On the day of admission and on the fifth day of follow-up, an ultrasound evaluation of the thickness of the biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris was performed. During the five-day period we also analyzed the energy and protein support that was provided to the patients.",

We performed a retrospective study aiming to compare the differences in nosocomial infection prevalence between a COVID19 period and a non-COVID-19 period, in a free-COVID-19 Internal Medicine ward from a central hospital in Lisbon. We included 393 patients, 192 patients being from the non-COVID-19 period and 201 patients from the COVID-19 period.",

We also found a statistically significant reduction in antibiotic usage (n = 31; 16.1% vs n = 11; 5.5%; p = 0.001) and in the occurrence of multidrug resistant organism infection (n = 9; 29.0% vs n = 1; 9.1%; p = 0.009) in the COVID-19 period.",

                    "Material and Methods: Prospective observational study over a 42-month period in a Stroke Unit of a tertiary University Hospital. All patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) were sequentially included. NLR was obtained at admission. Patient characteristics such as stroke subtype, severity and PSP diagnosis were ascertained. Score A2DS2 was used as clinical predictor of PSP.",
                    "Results: 521 patients with AIS were identified. The mean age was 76.17 ± 10.16 years years, 46.9% were men. Association was found between NLR and type and severity of stroke (p < 0.01), persisting in stratified analysis after excluding concomitant infection. Patients with higher ratio presented severer neurological deficits at admission, higher mortality, and dependency on discharge (p < 0.01). A logistic regression was performed to ascertain the predictive capacity of NLR (≥3) and A2DS2 (≥6) on the likelihood of developing PSP (p < 0.005). The model explained 17.1% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in pneumonia diagnoses, correctly classifying 77.0% of patients with 96.3% specificity. Patients with A2DS2 ≥6 were likelier to develop pneumonia (OR 8.36, p < 0.01). Moreover, patients with NLR ≥3 had higher odds of developing pneumonia (OR 2.35, p < 0.01).",
                    "Conclusion: NLR appears to be related to severity in AIS, possibly as surrogate of neuroimmune mediation. Advances in the understanding of the immunobiological effects of ischemia in the brain may lead to future therapeutic developments. Presently, as a relatively inexpensive biomarker, there may be a potential role for NLR in improving PSP prediction scores."

Clinically it is manifested by the tetrad: palpable purpura, arthritis/arthralgias, abdominal complaints and kidney injury. Although the pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, infections, medications and neoplasia have been suggested as triggers. Morbidity is related to the progression to chronic kidney disease. PHS is very common in children but rare in adults and the elderly. For this reason, we present two cases of HSP in two patients over 60 years old, with renal and intestinal injury. Because renal involvement and failure is most common in this population (when compared to children), it ismportant to consider this diagnosis in the adult population due to its important morbidity and mortality."

                    "Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the extracutaneous proliferation of clonal MC in the bone marrow or other extramedullary sites with or without cutaneous involvement. GastrointestinaI (GI) manifestations, consisting of abdominal pain, diarrhea and malabsorption with various degrees of severity, are frequent in patients with SM and can result from mediator release or direct MC infiltration of the GI tract. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic and recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort associated with defecation or change in bowel habit. The interaction between immune system and neuropeptides and the enhancement of an inflammatory mucosal response with an increase in immune cells is a key feature of IBS. Previous evidence shows that there is an increased number of MC in the intestinal and colonic mucosa of IBS patients. MC are present in the GI and their activation has been associated to some pro-secretory neurotransmitters such as substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the proximity of enteric nerves suggesting a bidirectional regulatory pathway with neurocrine control of MC activation. Research concerning the role of enteric MC in both SM and IBS is still scarce as well as their link to neuropeptides. Likewise, more evidence is needed regarding MC and neuropeptides interaction in order to further comprehend the pathophysiology of the GI manifestations of SM and IBS, and the boundaries between these pathologies. In this review we hypothesize that GI symptoms SM and in IBS have similar mechanisms and mediators, with a special focus in the role of mucosal MC and neuropeptides."

Home hospitalization is considered as a valid alternative to conventional hospitalization, characterized by providing hospitalized level healthcare at home and a personalized approach adapted to the individual reality of each patient in their usual environment. The direct connection between the health professionals, the patient and their caregivers outside the hostile environment of the hospital, and at the same time without losing the safety and quality of care, allows to reinforce the humanization of Medicine, improve the perception of the disease and create unique education and health promotion opportunities tailored to that patient or family. The aging of the population and the increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases are increasing the pressure on the number of hospital beds available. From the perspective of the sustainability of the NHS, home hospitalization reduces the costs and complications inherent to conventional hospitalization and can be a solution to the problem of overcrowding, with clinical advantages for the patient. Despite the national progression, home hospitalization continues to be little known by the population and professionals. This article aims to highlight and publicize the particularities of this quality service."

Screening programs and elective surgery may prevent such a life-threatening event. We pretend to evaluate if internal medicine residents would be able to perform quality abdominal ultrasound for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening, and therefore increase our diagnostic accuracy of this life-threatening condition. Material and Methods: Five internal medicine residents without previous experience in ultrasound screened men over 65 years admitted to Internal Medicine wards for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. The patients were evaluated in different times by two internal medicine residents, and a subset of patients was also evaluated by vascular surgery attendant or abdominal computed tomography scan (established as gold standard evaluations). Agreement between both internal medicine resident’s observations and internal medicine residents’ and gold standard evaluations were analyzed. Results: A total of 98 patients were evaluated, with 8 abdominal aortic aneurysms diagnosed, resulting in an 8.2% prevalence. There was good agreement regarding Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm presence and measurement between internal medicine residents’ examinations (κ = 0.918, p < 0.01) and internal medicine residents’/gold standard (κ = 0.950, p < 0.01). Discussion and Conclusion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm prevalence in our study was high. Internal medicine residents were able to accurately diagnose aortic abdominal aneurysm. Point of care opportunistic aortic abdominal aneurysm screening can be performed in Internal Medicine wards, providing an early diagnosis and referral for elective repair surgery."

Therefore, the correction of VD deficiency did not have impact in the variables analysed. The improvements reported within both groups may reflect the impact of the HF clinic optimized care."

The diagnosis represents a challenge not only due to the large number of known hepatotoxic products but especially when the substance involved is not known to induce liver damage. Empagliflozin is linked to several adverse effects but has not been convincingly associated to DILI. We report a case of a 70-year-old type 2 diabetic woman that presented with gastrointestinal symptoms 1 month after empagliflozin introduction. Elevated hepatic enzymes were found and despite ultrasound evidence of vesicular microlithiasis, no biliary obstruction was confirmed. Other causes of liver injury were excluded and the diagnosis of DILI secondary to empagliflozin was made after liver biopsy. Complete clinical and laboratorial resolution was verified after empagliflozin withdrawal. Only two cases of DILI were reported since empagliflozin licensure which makes this case more interesting, alerting clinicians to an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

                    "Hypertriglyceridemia increases not only the cardiovascular risk but can also cause abdominal pain and recurrent pancreatitis when in very high levels. Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that affects chylomicron metabolism. FCS is most commonly caused by mutation of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene, which results in triglycerides 10 times higher than normal. The phenotypic resemblance makes the differential diagnosis with multifactorial chylomicronaemia very difficult, requiring genetic testing. Treatment has 2 goals: reducing cardiovascular risk as well as pancreatitis prevention. Volanevorsen is authorized for FCS treatment, acting by triglyceride clearance non-related to lipoprotein lipase. Phase 2 studies showed an apoC-III and TG reduction of 79.6% and 70.9% respectively; in phase 3 studies the TG reduction was 77% with minor adverse reactions. Data on the cardiovascular risk reduction are limited. We propose an algorithm for the approach of hypertriglyceridemia adapted to the Portuguese reality. Exclusion of secondary causes for hypertriglyceridemia begins in primary care; hospital referral is needed to confirm the diagnosis based on the score proposed by Moulin et al in 2018."

On the other side, in asymptomatic patients or those with moderate symptoms, the underlying causes should first be investigated and removed/treated before any therapeutic intervention.

The aim of this study was to evaluate procedure success, use of echocardiogram, complications rate and usefulness for etiologic study of patients with pericardial effusion.",

There was a greater number of punctures necessary for success, a higher rate of complications and greater severity of them when pericardiocenteses was not guided by echocardiography, which explains worse outcomes when compared to other series where echocardiography was used in every single procedure. Pericardial fluid analysis did not allow extrapolating Light criteria for pleural effusion, however there was a tendency for an association between classic exudate cases (neoplasia and infection) and higher LDH in pericardial fluid; ADA>50 U/L was very specific for tuberculous pericardial effusion.

                    "Results: One hundred and one patients, 85% women, average age 50 years. The main reason for referencing was Raynaud´s phenomenon (93%). Capillaroscopic evaluation was suggestive of primary Raynaud´s phenomenon in 28 patients and secondary in 65.",
                    "Discussion: The results described, although in a small sample, allow to reinforce the usefulness of nailfold videocapillaroscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected microcirculatory dysfunction, especially in the context of autoimmune pathology. The early identification of individuals with a higher risk of progression to autoimmune disease will allow to optimize their follow-up, with regular surveillance, easy access to the medical team for an early detection of symptoms and regular laboratory evaluation.",
                    "Conclusion: Nailfold videocapillaroscopy is an accessible and low-cost exam, which contributes together with laboratory results for the early identification of individuals with secondary Raynaud´s phenomenon. The future development of this technique may represent a predictor of disease progression."

In order to contain the transmission alternative measures were adopted regarding care delivery to chronic diseases, namely through the use of telemedicine. Patient satisfaction with health care is associated with a better prognosis. In this study we intend to evaluate satisfaction with the provided health care in Internal Medicine telephonic appointments.",
                    "Material and Methods: After performing a literature review we created a questionnaire to evaluate patient satisfaction with telephonic appointments. All patients with Internal Medicine telephonic appointments on September 2020 were included. The questionnaire was applied to the patient or to a family member.",
                    "Results: The questionnaire was performed to 81 patients with an average age of 67.9 years and male predominance (53.1%). The questionnaire was answered by the patient himself in 71.6% of cases. Seventy patients (86.5%) agree/totally agree that telephonic appointments enabled health care that suited their needs and 88.8% agree/totally agree that it represents an acceptable way of health care delivery. The majority (74.1%) revealed satisfaction with telephonic appointments.",
                    "Discussion and Conclusion: We present a new satisfaction questionnaire that showed a good reliability and can represent an important tool in the future. In general patients attributed high total satisfaction scores to telephonic appointments, revealing its acceptance as an alternative way of receiving health care. The implementation of telemedicine during the current pandemic allows health care delivery to be maintained, representing a promising strategy."

Fear of exposure constrained medical evaluations which were delayed by either choice or imposition. Going to the emergency department (ED) was no exception. Our objective was to compare demographic, clinical and analytical characteristics of patients who died in a COVID-19 dedicated ED with the same period of 2019.",
                    "Material and Methods: Retrospective study analysing patient discharge notes who have died during ED permanence between March 18th and June 22nd of 2019 and in the same period of 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS software.",
                    "Results: A total of 33 patients died in 2019 whereas 99 died in 2020 during the analysed period, representing a mortality rate of 0.34% and 1.89%, respectively. Only 4.04% (n = 4) of deceased patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, while all showed severe respiratory infections. There was a statistically significant difference concerning length of stay in ED (p < 0.01), being bedridden (p = 0.04), dementia (p = 0.03) and presence of respiratory failure at admission (p = 0.001). There were no differences regarding demographic data, comorbidities, and other analytical parameters.",
                    "Conclusion: In 2020, deaths in the ED occurred among more vulnerable patients and with more severe disease. It was the later demand for hospital care, particularly in the worsening of chronic diseases, that irreversibly conditioned this outcome, especially in the context of chronic diseases exacerbation. Furthermore, the number of deaths that can be attributed to COVID-19 is negligible, deserving reflection and readaptation of good practices ensuring that patients are admitted to the ED within the recommended time and in accordance with the suspected pathologies."

It presents with non-specific symptoms, such as low back pain, hematuria or varicocele, that lead to late diagnosis. We present the case of a 22-year-old patient with multiple episodes of high-intensity and recurrent low back pain, usually preceding the beginning of the catamenium. The imaging study of the vascular territory revealed anomalies in the left pelvic venous vasculature, with duplication of the homolateral renal vein, conditioning pelvic congestion. After several admissions (3 hospitalizations with diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis), the patient underwent angioplasty of the left renal vein with embolization of the gonadal vein. After a period of symptomatic resolution, there was symptomatic relapse associated with renal dysfunction, which conditioned the renal autotransplantation with insertion in the left iliac fossa. A high level of suspicion is essential, especially in the absence of response to conservative treatment and in the recurrence of symptoms without imaging findings suggesting other pathologies of an obstructive and / or inflammatory nature."

Although several prognostic indexes exist in the literature, their applicability is difficult for several reasons. The authors of this article propose, therefore, as relevant data at the admission of a patient to the Internal Medicine ward, to facilitate the establishment of the prognosis and to allow a multidisciplinary approach plan, the following items: functional and cognitive status; prognosis- defining pathologies and frailty syndrome; surprise question at the emergency service; communication with the family."

Being a medical emergency, a swift diagnosis and rapid institution of prognostic changing measures is of the utmost importance. This article aims at reviewing the most recent guidelines and more relevant data published in order to define the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of intracranial hemorrhage. After a quick diagnosis, the application of severity scales is crucial to the stratification of the risk and in the definition of the most suitable therapeutical strategy, including medical and surgical measures. Medical interventions can be divided as primary and secondary. Primary measures include aggressive control of the blood pressure, reversal of anti-coagulation and rapid evaluation for the need of surgical intervention. Secondary measures include body temperature control, normoglycemia and hemodynamic, mental status and intracranial pressure monitoring. Simultaneously with the therapeutic approach, diligences must be initiated to ensure the transference of the patient to the right level of care, since delaying this step is associated with worse prognosis. This article intends to create an auxiliary tool in giving the best possible care to the patients with intracranial hemorrhage."

                    "Introduction: An Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme (AMSP) has been implemented in our hospital in the second semester of 2017. One of the goals was the reduction of the consumption of carbapenems and quinolones. This study aims to evaluate the evolution of the consumption of these drugs during the two years after implementing this programme. Methods: We analyzed the prescriptions of carbapenems and quinolones among inpatients between July 1st 2017 and June 30th 2019. The clinician reviewed each prescription and intervened, when necessary, directly with the prescriber. The consumption was calculated following the Nordic Council definition (2018 update) for the daily defined dose. Results: In the first year we identified 234 (35.0%) non- -conform prescriptions. Recommendations were addressed in 108 cases, of which 83.3% were accepted. The consumption of quinolones and carbapenems was reduced by 18.0% and 8.6%, respectively, relatively to the previous year. In the second year we identified 284 (34.5%) non-conform prescriptions. Recommendations were addressed in 215 cases, of which 94.0% were accepted. The consumption of quinolones and carbapenems was reduced by 55.7% and 10.3%, respectively. Discussion: Throughout this period, we found a reduction in the consumption of quinolones and carbapenems and an increase in compliance with the AMSP recommendations, reflecting a better education for prescription. This favors a more adequate use of antimicrobials, with lesser predisposal to the development of resistance. Conclusion: In our hospital, the AMSP is leading to a reduction in the use of carpabenems and quinolones, with good acceptance of the recommendations by the prescribers."

                    "Methods: Retrospective longitudinal study which included patients in an Intensive Care Unit in 2016 and 2017, in whom NIV was started once they developed de novo ARF (PaO2/ FiO2 < 200). We included patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and compared NIV-responders to non-responders.",
                    "Results: Between 2016 and 2017, 83 patients with de novo ARF were treated with NIV. Of those, 50 (60%) were treated successfully. The most common cause of ARF was CAP, which was successfully managed with NIV in 70% of cases. NIV-responders presented lower severity scores (APACHE 2; SAPS 2; SOFA) at admission (17.5; 37.5; 6 vs 22; 48; 9, p=0.014, p=<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively). Non-responders presented significantly lower arterial pH values at admission (7.35 vs 7.42, p<0.01), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (118 vs 145, p=0.03), higher seric lactate (2.2 vs 1.46, p<0.01) as well as need for vasopressor support (51.5% vs 30%, p=0.04). The change in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio within 2 hours of treatment was wider in the group of NIV-responders, unlike non-responders (+53, p<0.01 vs +14, p=0.09).",
                    "Conclusion: NIV was an effective respiratory support strategy in 60% of patients with de novo ARF. Patients who seem to have a higher probability of NIV success are: patients with CAP; with or without moderate ARDS, rather than severe; with no respiratory acidaemia; patients with no lactacidemia or patients with no need for vasopressor therapy. The ability of NIV to significantly alter the PaO2/FiO2 ratio after 2 hours of technique seems to be a good success predictor."

Absence of specific clinical information excluded patients. Demographic, clinical and diagnostical data were analysed.",
                    "Results: In this study, female gender was the most prevalent. Cutaneous, articular, cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal involvements were present in both autoantibodies’ groups, with no renal manifestations. In 40% of both groups, systemic sclerosis diagnosis was established. No other concomitant autoantibodies were documented in 53% and 50% of anti-Th/To and anti-NOR90, respectively.",
                    "Discussion and Conclusion: This study verified similar involvement in both groups with frequent skin and articular symptoms, more cardiopulmonary involvement in anti-Th/To group and more gastrointestinal association in anti-NOR90. Although, in this study, these autoantibodies were commonly related to systemic sclerosis, in approximately half of cases they were isolated with no other concomitant systemic sclerosis’ autoantibodies, enhancing the importance of their active research when this disease is suspected."

                    "Results: Of the 432 admitted patients, 279 individuals were included. The median age was 69 years and 57% were male. The most common comorbidities were high blood pressure (66.3%), dyslipidemia (33.3%), diabetes (27.1%) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (26.5%). The most common symptoms included fever (74.4%), cough (67.0%) and dyspnea (59.9%). Ferritin, C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels were elevated in 86.3%, 74.8% and 73.9% of patients, respectively. Mortality rate was 17.3%. 32.3% of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 31.9% were admitted to intensive care unit and 20.8% were ventilated. In multivariable analysis, age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.09, p=0.023), CVD (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.21–5.93, p=0.015) and lymphocyte count <0.5x109/L (OR 6.61, 95% CI 2.23–19.62, p=0.001) were risk factors for in-hospital mortality.",

It is characterized by pain and sensory abnormalities, such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Prevalence varies from 5% to 50% (thalamic stroke) and it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated.

                    "The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic triggers antagonistic reactions, between those who consider this to be a benign infection and those who classify it as a severe one, some who find the measures excessive and some that believe them to be insufficient. This infection is usually asymptomatic or mild, and only rarely is severe or critical, with lethality rates that are two to three times those of the seasonal flu. Nevertheless, the number of patients in need of admission to the hospital and of intensive care is variable from region to region, and might overwhelm the health system. Scientific evidence supporting the mitigation measures is scarce, and control groups inexistent, with data that shed doubt on real life effectiveness of lockdowns, contact tracing, disinfection of surfaces, objects and hands, school closures and mask use, on reducing the number of new cases. Interventions put in place to strengthen the hospital system might be insufficient and, in Portugal, there are no defined recommendations to avoid unbeneficial admissions to Intensive Care Units. A monitoring system to analyze the hospital system’s capacity and to adjust it to real time needs would be paramount, not only for the present pandemic, but also for future similar situations."

The main objective of this study was to assess the opinions of medical students and interns about pre-graduate education in PC, and its contribution to the medical profession.",
                    "Material and Methods: Qualitative study (online questionnaire) with descriptive treatment of the data. Participants were last-year students at Medical Schools of Portugal and first-year interns.",
                    "Results: Of the 221 participants, 61% were students, the majority attended PC classes which lasted <8 hours. Participants considered the discipline of PC relevant for the medical education, but it should have a higher workload and should give the necessary knowledge to any general practitioner. There should be more education on symptoms of terminally ill patients, physical signs of imminent death, and communication of bad news. Participants revealed a good knowledge of the philosophy of PC and felt familiar with the main concepts of PC. Students did not have access to a practical, specialized environment for PC.",
                    "Conclusion: In Portugal, although the pre-graduate education in PC is insufficient, it has had a positive effect, with high theoretical knowledge, but with little practice in PC. Medical Schools should invest more in pre-graduate education in PC, through the obligatory curriculum and regular clinical practices, empowering students for an empathic and compassionate relationship between the doctor and the patient in PC."

                    "Material and Methods: Descriptive study. All patients from primary health care (PHC) were selected at ARS Alentejo Central, referred to the emergency department (ED) of Hospital Espírito Santo de Évora, for the specialty of Internal Medicine, in the month of January and July 2017. To perform the statistical analysis, the Speed Statistics® (SPSS) was used.",
                    "Results: About 15% of patients admitted to the emergency department are from PHC and 50% of these are forwarded for internal medicine. About 57% of patients have priority and the most frequent reason for referral is respiratory symptoms. A major conclusion carries out complementary diagnostic tests. It was found that 75% of the admitted patients were discharged to the home, 25% of whom had no acute pathology or had not been diagnosed in the ED.",

It is necessary to reflect and change the strategy, with the objective of improving the efficiency of the national health system, culminating in greater comfort for the patient. It would also be attractive to make multidisciplinary teams, in support of PHC, to discuss cases of acute pathology and decide on the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach. In this way, it would be possible to reduce the consumption of resources, creating a more patient-centred approach."

D-dimer dosing has sensitivity of over 95% and high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of VTE. Our goal was to analyse every Emergency Department episode in which d-dimer dosing was performed. The variables analysed were: presence or absence of clinical symptoms suggestive of VTE, the suitability of D-dimer request according to pre-test probability scores, performance of computed tomography angiography (angio-CT) if D-dimer elevation and number of confirmed VTE.",

We documented 110 episodes with D-dimer dosing without any suggestive symptoms of VTE. In four patients with high pre-test probability D-dimer was inadequately performed. D-dimer elevation was observed in 55,5% (327/589) of all episodes, but only 28,1% were submitted to angio-CT. Total VTE confirmed was 27 (4,6%).",

                    "SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, surprised the world with its capacity of infection, causing a public health emergency concern with more than 3 million people affected in only four months and forcing public institutions to search for ways of obtaining the contention of the virus. The mortality rate is very different among the countries, considering their age structure and the percentage of comorbidities. Elderly and people with underlying diseases are more susceptible to develop severe cases of COVID-19 and have higher case fatality rate. Cardiovascular diseases have a particular importance, given that their prevalence is elevated and considering the infection pathophysiology. Virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors to invade the human cells. These receptors are mainly in the lungs and the heart. Besides the direct viral insult, hypoxia, cytokines storm and catecholamine’s liberation also affect these organs. In the heart, studies have shown that COVID-19 can cause myocarditis, ventricular arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. Moreover, the cardiovascular insult may be the first manifestation of viral infection in some cases, which is a matter of increased concern during this pandemic. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are drugs of paramount importance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, studies suggested concern about these medications in COVID-19 because they could cause an ACE2 upregulation and increase the severity of the infection. To the best of our knowledge, no study demonstrated that ACE inhibitors or ARB are harmful and the main cardiovascular societies are recommending the continuity of the treatment."

                    "Heart failure (HF) is a serious burden for the public health in Portugal, being associated to high morbidity and mortality. The clinical management of HF is complex and the disease awareness and healthcare articulation need to be improved. HF patients are frequently hospitalized due to acute episodes. These hospital stays are excellent opportunities for the optimization of the HF clinical management. According to the international recommendations, checklists must be used by the medical staff when dealing with hospitalized HF patients, to improve the clinical outcomes of the disease, and hence, mitigate the clinical and financial impact of the disease. With this position statement the Study Group for Heart Failure (NEIC) from the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine (SPMI) proposes the implementation of a checklist for the hospital discharge of HF patients in order to improve the clinical management of hospitalized HF patients in Portugal. The purposed checklist follows all the relevant international guidelines and recommendations for the management of HF, considering the Portuguese clinical practice, epidemiology and demography."

A two rounds Delphi method was performed, with participation of 105 panellists including internists, other clinicians, nurses, patients, lawyers, bioethicists, health managers, politicians, and journalists. A questionnaire with 5 Likert-type answers for each recommendation was sent to panellists. Strong consensus was defined as > 95% answers completely agree or > 90% agree or completely agree; and weak consensus when > 90% answers completely agree or > 80% agree or completely agree.",

In some countries, it has caused serious and simultaneous infections, in such a large number that several health systems disrupted. There are more doubts than certainties about its pathophysiology and treatment, but it is already clear that it is a systemic disease, which is initiated more often by respiratory symptoms No etiological treatment is known. Supportive treatment in the most severe cases is less effective than expected, requiring different strategies than we knew so far. The most effective attitudes so far are those that were recommended in the middle ages: social distancing, preven- tion of contacts and confinement. The pandemic makes humanity vulnerable as a whole, \"justifies\" massive restrictions on circulation and freedoms, precipitates an economic crisis of unknown proportions. No one knows what will happen in the future, to the survivors and to the possibility of recirculation of the virus. It is time to reflect the human condition and human relations. Society organization will change, and we will be protagonists."

The US has been has been severely affected and remains the country with the highest recorded number of infections and deaths due to this corona virus. The heterogeneous distribution of cases appears to due to a number of factors: individualized responses across different states, a lack of a coherent federal policy, a lack of preparation, the climate of mis/dis-information and the politicization as a result of it occurring in an election year. Add to that a global worsening of health measures for many Americans including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking among others. On the positive side, the scientific collaboration, the observations of astute clinicians and the continued efforts of the public health sector to re-direct the conversation towards scientific truths have played a good part in the fight against this infection. While there is a concern for the hype associated with incessant reporting of the news, let us try to find a common and safe path to live with this virus while protecting the older population and those at risk. Achieving herd immunity or effective vaccination will go a long way towards a return to a new kind of normality."

In this review of the latest information on SARS-COV-2 immunobiology, we focused on the hypotheses that support a defective innate and acquired immunity to the virus, and the contribution of a dysfunctional immune response for the progression and mortality associated with the disease. Based on this new information, we point out the main immunotherapy strategies targeting the virus, the dysfunctional immune response and the disease prophylaxis (immunization). Improving our knowledge on the pathogen-host interactions will open the way to identify the best strategies for the diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19, as well as to the best preventive measures."

The spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infections to progressive critical states, a direct upshot from the complex interplay between virus pathogenicity and host antiviral defense. This review focuses on the immunologic response and disarrangements underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, gathering the information not only from the lessons learnt from SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics but also from what is already known about SARS-CoV-2 to date. This knowledge is paramount from the standpoint of disease prevention and control as well as di- agnostic pipeline and treatment."

Health systems had to quickly adapt to a pandemic that challenged the resilience of states and society. We look at the consequences of the first phase of the pandemic in health systems reorganization (with limited access to care and priority shifted to COVID-19) and to the changes in the cardiovascular risk patients behaviour (such as isolation, fear of infection and anxiety). These indirect mechanisms may have contributed to cardiovascular disease under-diagnosis, or to the delay in diagnosis and treatment, and may have contributed to the increase in the registered mortality, even in people without SARS-CoV-2 infection."

                    "Introduction: Neoplasia is considered the second disease with the highest morbidity and mortality. Hospital-level care is often unavoidable. The objective of Home Hospitalization (HH) is to minimize hospital complications and provide greater satisfaction to the patient and family/caregiver.",
                    "Material and Methods: This article reports one year of HH experience at the Unidade Local de Saúde of Castelo Branco with regard to patients with oncological pathology.",
                    "Results/Discussion: In the first year of HH, 99 patients were admitted, 22.2% (n = 22) of whom had oncological pathology. Sixty four percent were male and the average age was 65.9 years old (±12.8). The average hospital stay was 6.8 days (±3.4). Seventy seven percent had active cancer disease. The main existing neoplasias were: 31.8% lung, 22.7% hematological, 18.1% prostate and 13.6% breast. Of these, 58.8% were under chemotherapy and 17.6% had undergone recent surgery or radiation therapy. The main comorbidities found in these patients were: hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and chronic pain. The main reasons for hospitalization were: febrile neutropenia (36.3%), respiratory infection (27.2%) and pain control (13.6%). One patient died, one was transferred to hospital and three readmissions. Ninety days after discharge, 63.6% did not return to the hospital.",
                    "Conclusion: Hospitalization in patients with neoplasia is very common. These are at increased risk of suffering from in-hospital infections, which increases mortality. The HH is advantageous because it reduces complications and provides a better quality of life for patients, given that they are undergoing qualified treatment in their own home."

Escherichia coli was the most frequent bacterium, and there was a significant decrease in its prevalence between the two periods. There was a significant decrease in the resistance rate of Escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole) and an increase in Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin, quinolones and cephalosporins showed global sensitivities greater than 90%. In the two-year period, the prescription of quinolones decreased while that of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin increased.",
                    "Discussion: The profile of Escherichia coli resistance to quinolones found in our study is lower than that previously documented in Portugal. Progress towards compliance with the national guideline has been made by decreasing the prescription of quinolones and co-trimoxazole, leading to an improvement in the profile of sensitivities to these antibiotics.",
                    "Conclusion: Despite the declining trend in the prescription of quinolones, this class of antibiotics is still the most prescribed, requiring optimization of local prescription."

Reports of isolated nodal lymphangioleiomyomatosis rare. Its treatment and prognosis are not well established. We describe a 48-year-old female patient presenting with ureter compression by an extensive retroperitoneal mass. Biopsy showed nodal lymphangioleiomiomatosis. A partial surgical resection of the lesions was performed. She is under yearly thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography control, last performed 3 years after diagnosis, with no lung involvement or new abdominal lesions. She evolved to menopause after 6 months. Some case series suggest that isolated nodal lymphangioleiomyomatosis may precede lung involvement by one to two years, having size as a risk factor (>10 mm). Relative stabilization of the disease course in postmenopausal women is described. This case reports an atypical evolution, with two >10mm diameter lesion, with 3-year follow-up without pulmonary, renal or other forms of lymphatic involvement."

                    "Results: Hundred eighty one patients, 57.5% females, aged 80.0±7.1 years old were included. Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 1/3 as undernourished and 66.3% as at risk for malnutrition. The great majority did not have a good socio-familial situation. Almost 2/3 had high risk of falling. Over 80% had no or mild risk for developing pressure ulcers. Over half were discharged home. Moderate correlations were found between nutritional status and both dependence for activities of daily living (ADL) and risk of developing pressure ulcers.",
                    "Discussion: We found a high incidence of malnutrition, dependence for ADL, socio-familial problems and high risk of falling. We found a statistically significant relation between nutritional status and risk of developing pressure ulcers, constituting an important alert that nutritional evaluation and support may have a crucial role in people’s quality of life.",

To the best of our knowledge, this was the first survey of malnutrition and its implications carried out in a Portuguese convalescence unit."

These patients had criteria for acute myocar-dial infarction in 66% and of acute myocardial injury without infarction in 33%. Age was higher in myocardial infarction patients, whilst there were no differences in other clinical, management or prognostic features. Patients were elderly and fragile, with a higher prevalence of several comorbidities, when compared with studies based on Cardiology departments. Mortality was high, with half the patients dying within a year, even with the prescription of statins in 64% and antiplatelets in 60%."

We present a case of a 30-year-old woman, with acute gastroenteritis, who received intravenous (IV) omeprazole, and immediately experienced intensive retrosternal pain, hypotension and altered state of consciousness. It was confirmed acute ischemia and high levels of myocardial lesion markers. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with favourable evolution. Anaphylaxis cases reported due to PPI are exceedingly rare; the mechanism is IgE-mediated, with class effect and possibility of cross reaction with ranitidine. Kounis’s syndrome represents an association of acute myocardial infarction type 2 with anaphylactic shock. Despite seldom, due to a general use of PPI, this side effect should be considered, especially with intravenous administration."

                    "Neuromyotonia is an exceedingly rare disease. In most cases it seems to be acquired, with a probable autoimmune origin. It is characterized by peripheral nerve hyperexcitability with muscle hyperactivity and deficient relaxation, and it is frequently accompanied by autonomic and sensitive symptoms. The diagnosis is established by electromyography, showing spontaneous, multiple single motor unit discharges, firing at a high frequency. The diagnosis is relevant not only to achieve symptom control but also for its known association with neoplasia, which must be ruled out. Nevertheless, the diagnosis is difficult to establish due to the nonspecific and variable symptoms that may lead to confusion with the more common psychiatric or motor neuron diseases. Misdiagnose can result in incorrect therapeutic actions with further iatrogenic symptoms. We report a typical case of neuromyotonia, in respect of which we review the clinical presentation, complementary diagnostic methods, natural evolution and treatment of the disease."

                    "Introduction: Diabetes mellitus prevalence in palliative patients tends to rise. The therapeutic goal guided strategies commonly used in diabetic patients are inadequate in the context of palliative care. Actually, these strategies may compromise the principles of well-being and quality of life by focusing on the prevention of long-term complications. The issues in this context are numerous. What is the target value of adequate metabolic control? Does HbA1C-based disease control remain acceptable? What drugs should we prefer in these patients? Our purpose is to review up-todate literature concerning the best practices in managing diabetes mellitus on a terminal ill patient.",
                    "Methods: At November 2019, we searched review articles, observational studies, guidelines, and opinion articles with the terms “palliative care” and “diabetes mellitus” published in the last 10 years, in English, Spanish and Portuguese, on the databases: Medline / PubMed, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scienc- Direct.",
                    "Results: When managing diabetes mellitus in a terminally ill patient, it is imperative to keep in mind the ultimate clinical goal for the patient: to prevent acute complications of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Most studies report that HbA1C monitorization has little relevance. Screening for capillary glycemia should be reduced or abolished. If performed, values between 108 and 270 mg / dL should be tolerated if the average life expectancy is months or values between 180- 360 mg/dl if the average life expectancy is weeks or days. To establish an individualized therapeutic plan, the palliative care team should take into account several characteristics of the patient and caregivers. Every change should represent an effort to simplify therapeutic schemes. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of each drug, side effects and potential for hypoglycemia should be considered. Strict avoidance of sugary food is not necessary."

Hire the best. Nurses? As judiciously as pos- sible. Other technicians? The same. Managers? Find “nice” people, well educated, resourceful... without having a clear idea of what for. Of what concretely are their functions. The reasons are two mistakes. The first mistake is not knowing what is (and the importance of) management. The second mistake is to believe that one knows but one does not know; namely to believe that in “knowledge institutions” (orga- nizations intensive in know-how) what counts is the scientists and technicians’ know-how and not the organization to make them most productive. To facilitate their work.Thus, the questions: could it be that leadership does not apply to knowledge institutions (in general) and health ones (in particular)? Why? And what is leadership? And why did Peter Drucker, founder of modern management, say that leadership both does not exist, and it is fundamental? How can that be?Let us start by the beginning."

The European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q) is the most recently validated in Europe, it has a validated Portuguese version and it categorizes 4 different degrees of health literacy (excellent, sufficient, problematic and insufficient). Lower degrees of literacy are associated with worse incidence and severity of illness, hospital- ization rates and higher morbidity and mortality. The goal was to assess the health literacy level in relation to healthcare.",
                    "Material and Methods: Application of the Portuguese ver- sion of the HLS-EU (HLS-PT) questionnaire to patients admitted to internal medicine care. All patients admitted to the internal medicine ward were initially included. Exclusion criteria were evidence of cognitive or clinical inability to answer the questionnaire.",
                    "Results: 64 patients were surveyed. Study population was mostly male (57%) with an average age of 71 years, retired (71.8%) and with low level of education (56.2% with academic education up to junior school). The majority (68.7%) had a prob- lematic or insufficient health literacy.",
                    "Conclusion: Although the authors recognize that both the environment of the questionnaire application and the demographic characteristics of this study differ from the national and European study, it is a disturbing result regarding health literacy in hospitalized individuals with chronic diseases."

                    "Methodology: A retrospective and observational study is presented, including patients aged ≥ 60 years, for a period of three months. It was applied the Palliative Care Screening Tool scale (PCST) in order to identify the potential candidates for Palliate Care (score ≥ 4).",
                    "Results: Three hundred and twenty-eight patients were admitted, but only 288 (88%) were evaluated and 54% of them presented score ≥ 4 points at PCST scale, eligible for PC. In this group, the average age was 82 years; 54% women and 46% men. Admission median was 11 days. The main co- morbidities were dementia in 47%, stroke in 45% and chronic kidney disease in 39%. The appreciation of psychological problems was not recognized. The mortality rate was 31% and only one patient was admitted in PC unit.",
                    "Conclusion: This study testifies that PC patients are hos- pitalized in Internal Medicine Services, and it also shows the importance of specific training of internists as well as research in this particular area and the use of specific scales with the potential to identify these patients."

                    "Introduction: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the main causes of death in Portugal. Research on the epi- demiologic history might help to understand the phenomenon and guide intervention strategies. Objectives: (1) Describe historic trends in mortality. (2) Estimate the impact of demographic variations on the registered number of cases.",
                    "Methods: (1) We calculated rates, specific and standard- ized, for deaths registered as CVD (ICD-10: I60-I69, G45; ICD- 8/9: 430-438; ICD-6/7: 330-334) by sex (1902-2012) and by sex and age groups (1913-2012). We used Join point analysis to identify statistically significant changes in standardized death rates, and multivariate regression models, Poisson and negative binomial, controlling for demographic dynamics and time trend, from 1913 to 2012. (2) We calculated the contribution of demographic variations using the application RiskDiff. (3) We evaluated if changes in coding rules might have been a source of bias. Data source: National Institute of Statistics.",
                    "Results: (1) We gathered the longest and most discriminated mortality series from CVD in Portugal with data since the beginning of nationwide collection. Mortality increases exponentially with age and is higher in men. (2) We observed sig- nificant variations in age-standardized time trends (1913-1933: APC 2.0%; 1933-1955: APC -0.9%; 1955-1974: 2.9%; 1974- 1996: -2.4%; 1996-2012: -6.5%). (3) Population ageing exerted a significant pressure to increase the number of deaths, particularly in the second half of the twentieth century. However, this effect was counterweighted by protective factors.",
                    "Conclusion: CVD mortality in Portugal is particularly expressive when compared to other European countries, although significant gains have been observed in the last decades. Population ageing combined with a transition between the morbid and mortality dimensions changed the public health paradigm."

                    "Methods: A prospective, single-centre study carried out in a tertiary internal medicine ward. Patients admitted with 65 years or more and with 5 or more medications were randomized to receive either usual physician and pharmacist care (control) or providing the patient ́s attending medical team, within the first 72 hours, a pop-up recommendation indicating potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) and potentially prescribing omissions (PPO) as a result of the application of the STOPP/START version 2 criteria (intervention). Statistical analysis done with SPSS version 23 considered a p <0.05.",

The team observed an average PIM and PPO reduction of 49% and 31% in the intervention group versus 13% and 0% in the control group (p = 0.01). There was an average acceptance of 63% for STOPP and 40% for START criteria recommendations. In the overall population the team found a prevalence of polypharmacy of 21% and of inappropriate prescription (at least one PIM) of 75.4% and identified a total of 230 PIM and 153 PPO.",

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has shown good results in critically ill with ARF. The evidence of NIPPV outcomes in old patients is scarce. The aim of our study is to analyse outcomes of NIPPV use in this population.",

We included and consecutively compared patients aged 75 years old or more (study group) and under 65 years old (control group) submitted to NIPPV due to ARF. The primary endpoint was mortality (in-hospital and 30 days after discharge). Secondary endpoints were NIPPV settings, complications, and failure rate.",
                    "Results: A total of 109 patients were included. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the study group (22.2 % vs 8.1%, p< 0.01).

Additional workup concluded pancytopenia (Hb 6.4 g/dL; Htc 19%; leuc 2600/L; plat 126000/L), macrocytosis (VGM 113 fL), hyperbilirubinemia (total 2.64 mg/dL), prolonged prothrombin time (INR 1.47), hypoalbuminemia (2.8 mg/dL) and fibrotic changes in hepatic architecture on ultrasound. Upon thorough examination, an extensive purpuric lesion on both lower limbs associated with perifollicular haemorrhagic papules, corkscrew hair, gingival hypertrophy, and lack of teeth was noted. Even though it is rarely seen nowadays, the semiology findings suggested vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency, known as scurvy. This diagnosis was confirmed via laboratory testing that quantified seric vitamin C <1 mg/L (ref value 2-15 mg/dL), as well as vitamin B12 value of 186 ng/L (ref value 193-982 ng/L) and folic acid value of <1ng/mL (ref value 3-17 ng/mL). Vitamin supplementation and healthy nutrition were begun showing a favourable outcome with hematoma, purpura, and pancytopenia regression. The clinical manifestations of vitamin deficiency, like scurvy, can be vast and overlooked, if this outdated diagnosis is not considered, leading to unnecessary investigation and erroneous diagnoses."

Of the 96 individuals evaluated, 60 met the inclusion criteria: age ≥ 65 years; Dementia diagnosis with assessment by Mini Mental State Examination between 10 and 24 points. The ethical procedures of the Helsinki Decla- ration have been complied with. Data collection took place in eight institutions.",
                    "Results: Cronbach’s alpha was 0.79 (evaluator 1 and 2) in the PPT-9 items and 0.69 (evaluator 1) and 0.70 (evaluator 2) in the PPT-7 items. The values of test-retest reliability var- ied between 0.65 and 0.72 (evaluator 1) and 0.52 and 0.91 (evaluator 2), except for item 3. The values inter-rater reliability exceeded 0.95. For the PPT-9 and PPT-7 items, the correlation was 0.99. The convergence of the PPT-9 items with the IB is 0.65 and the PPT-7 items is 0.64.",

Despite recent treatment improvements, information is scarce regarding etiology and prognosis. Our aim was to determine the incidence of pericarditis with a known etiology and assess clinical prognostic predictors.",
                    "Material and Methods: A clinical retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with acute pericarditis was conducted from 2012 to 2016. Population was characterized according to etiology, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis. Outcomes of interest, evaluated at one year after hospital discharge, were pericarditis recurrence, hospitalization, constric- tion and overall mortality.",
                    "Results: A total of 94 patients were enrolled, median age 46 years (inter-quartile range 32-61), 65% were male. Idio- pathic etiology was responsible for 68% of cases. A specific etiology was found in the remaining 32% of patients, being the most frequent autoimmune disease (12%) and malignancy (5%). Idiopathic pericarditis was associated with myopericarditis (p = 0.049) and a known etiology with pericardial effusion (p = 0.001) and cardiac tamponade (p = 0.027). Recurrence of pericarditis was found in 13% of patients. Corticosteroid treatment in patients with an identified etiology was not associated with an increase in recurrence (p = 0.220). Overall 1-year mortality was 9%. A defined etiology was the only independent predictor of mortality at multivariate analysis (OR 40.3; 95% CI 1.9 – 137.2; p = 0.016).",
                    "Conclusion: Up to one third of hospitalized patients with acute pericarditis have an identified cause of pericarditis and these patients are at increased risk of mortality."

Ketamine was used as an adjuvant treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain in 18 patients, and in two to treat depression. In the first group all patients had unbearable pain and 22% showed signs of opioids adverse effects; 73% had mixed pain. They were treated with high doses of opioids-equivalent to a median dose of 422.5 mg/ day of oral morphine. The average dose of ketamine was 85 mg/ day, median 80 mg/day, in continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion in 90% of them. The dose of opioid decreased in 12% and the rescue opioid dose in 53%. In 70% the pain was relieved. Improvement in pain was found in an average of 4.8 days. All received neuroleptics with or without benzodiazepines. The psychotomimetic side effects in one patient forced to discontinue ketamine. Patients with depression demonstrated an improve- ment in mood as the main response to a single dose of ketamine.",

Reassessed in the emergency 5 days after the event with trismus, opisthotonos, respiratory failure and dysautonomia. We proceeded to wound cleaning, immunoglobulin and antibiotic therapy administration, sedation, ventilatory support and we transferred the patient to an intensive care unit. It was a case without prophylaxis, showing that tetanus is still a threat that should alert us all to the immunological situation and compli- ance with the national vaccination plan."

This review aims to provide a critical analysis on the positive and negative aspects concerning the impact of a vegetarian diet in cardiovascular risk.",
                    "Results: Overall, vegetarian population presents better cardiovascular risk profile, expressed by lower body mass index, better blood pressure control, reduced pro-atherogenic lipids and better glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity. Other atherogenic paths seem to be influenced, such as chylomicron remnants removal from circulation, oxidative and inflammation profile, blood fluidity and intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, imaging methods have shown better structural and functional vas- cular properties among vegetarians. However, a non-balanced vegetarian diet might lead to nutrients deficit, which could nullify these advantages. These limitations may be overcome through a carefully planned diet and, in some cases, supplements or fortified foods. Ultimately, a beneficial effect is associated with a healthy vegetarian concept, with scarce intake of refined and processed food products, avoiding overconsumption of sugar and trans fats.",
                    "Conclusion: Vegetarian diet brings a positive impact in sever- al independent cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the additional challenge in reaching specific macro and micronutrients which are less available in plant-based foods, their shortage can be avoided by planning a well-balanced and complete diet, based on healthy and natural food components. As there is the acknowledgment of its limitations and corresponding precautions are taken, a vegetarian diet could be used as an effective weapon towards prevention and management of cardiovascular disease."

The optimal rate of radiotherapy use in the final months of life is unclear; therefore, its use must be judicious. But would incorporate anticipated efficacy in patients whose survival allows it and minimize overuse among patients with expected short survival. Studies have shown that oncologists overestimate patient survival times of patients with advanced cancer and expose terminally ill patients to the burden of longer fractionated courses of radiotherapy with no further benefits.

The disease is characterized by fever, headache, rash and arthralgia with an acute unset. Arthralgia may progress and become persistent. Atypical manifestations, severe but rare, include neurologic disease. It is associated with morbidity, due to persistent arthralgia, and mortality. The diagnosis is performed by polymerase chain reaction or by IgM and IgG antibodies detection.

                    "Introduction: Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial infec- tion that rarely affects the respiratory system. Lung infection usually develops after aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal secretions. Typically, it presents with pneumonia, lung abscess or empyema, and the most common radiologic presentation is a pulmonary mass, simulating a tumour. Adequate treatment requires prolonged antibiotic therapy to prevent relapse. In this article we made a literature review on actinomycosis and analysed patients’ data from Pedro Hispano Hospital.",
                    "Methods: Medical records from twelve-year data (January 2006 - December 2017) on pulmonary actinomycosis were consulted. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected and analysed.",
                    "Results: Five patients were diagnosed with pulmonary actinomycosis, three males and two females. Mean age was 55 years. The most frequent microorganism was Actinomyces meyeri, identified in bronchoalveolar lavage in one case, and pleural fluid samples in other two cases. The other patients had isolation of Actinomyces odontolyticus and Actinomyces spp. All presented favourable response to treatment except for one patient, who died from empyema with septic shock. In one case, after a good therapeutic response, there was abandonment of the consultation and follow-up could not be maintained.",
                    "Conclusion: Presently, actinomycosis is a rare disease with good prognosis if diagnosed early and treated appropriately. It should always be considered as a differential diagno- sis of a persistent parenchymal lung lesion."

All patients presented with spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma. Forty-four percent were severe, according to the Classification of Berná, and the mortality rate was 11%. Abdominal pain and a fall in the haemoglobin level (mean of 3.7 ± 1.8 g/dL) were the most common clinical manifestations and diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography. All patients were under anticoagulants. Those treated with dicoumarins had a supratherapeutic INR (mean 6.0 ± 2.6) and a precipitating factor (cough), contrary to those under low-molecular weight heparin. Anticoagulation was reversed in 6 cases. Five patients were discharged under anticoagulants and had no rectus sheath hematoma recurrence.",

Although a rare complication, it can have a fatal outcome. Efforts to guarantee a correct administration of low-molecular weight heparin, rigorous INR control and high clinical suspicion with early diagnosis are nec- essary to avoid it."

                    "Dementia is a progressive neurological syndrome without cure whose prevalence is increasing due to population ageing. There is a lack of knowledge among healthcare professionals and caregivers regarding the best feeding approach in patients with advanced dementia. As there are no national recommendations on this subject, a consensus report from the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine and the Portuguese Enteral and Parental Nutrition Society was made, clarifying existing guidelines regarding the approach of eating difficulties in these patients.Advanced dementia is a terminal condition where patient comfort should be the goal. These patients are usually bedbound, have limited ability to communicate verbally and have difficulty eating. In this population, current literature does not support tube feeding (nasogastric tube, nasojejunal tube, percutaneous gastrostomy or percutaneous jejunostomy feeding), which is associated with higher rates of infection, greater use of chemical and physical restraints and development of pressure ulcers. As an alternative, careful hand feeding should be offered (comfort feeding). From an ethical and legal standpoint, it is acceptable not to use tube feeding in the terminal phase of dementia if it is against patient values and offers no benefits. This decision should be made using a multidisciplinary approach including the patient (if possible), legal representative, caregivers, family and healthcare professionals, in order to establish an individual care plan allowing decision making in the patient’s best interest."

Clinical manifestations and symptoms maybe difficult to interpret. Although inflammation may prevail,the state of immunosenescence makes the infectious disease pauci-symptomatic and different from usual. Adynamia,fever, and cough, are often interpreted and medicated as infection. Besides, although infection is common at the end oflife, it is often a marker of gravity and not the problem itself.Antibiotics, usually used in this context, may not serve thebest interests of the patient and contribute to the development of resistant microorganisms, which has negative implications at the community level. In this article, we discussthe potential benefits and risks of antibiotic therapy in thispopulation, which, in our opinion, should be included in thescope of palliative care."

The authors have hypothesized that hospitalization could be an opportunity to screen DSPN and alsopretend to compare two different diagnostic methods.Material and Methods: This was a prospective and multicentre study that enrolled diabetic patients admitted consecutively to internal medicine wards, between May and October2015. Patients were evaluated using the MNSI (MichiganNeuropathy Screening Instrument) and the SWME (10 gSemmes-Weinstein monofilament examination). A score > 2in the clinical examination of MNSI or ≤ 7 positive answers ina total of 10 in SWME were considered diagnostic of DSPN.Results: Eighty-eight patients were included; average agewas 77 (13) years and 45% were males; most were type 2 diabetic patients, 7% had a previous diagnosis of DSPN. DSPNprevalence was 75% using MNSI, SWME was abnormal in 38%of these patients. The agreement rate between MNSI and SWMEwas 44.3%. A percentage of 92.4% of the patients with a diagnosis of DSPN in the study did not have a previous diagnose.Discussion: The number of underdiagnosed cases in thisstudy is alarming but had been previously detected in studiesregarding outpatient; it might represent a problem of registryor an omission in the screening of neuropathy.Conclusion: We have concluded that DSPN is a highprevalent disease in hospitalized patients in Portugal, whichremains underdiagnosed. MNSI can be a good instrument toscreen neuropathy and SWME should not be used exclusivelyfor this purpose."

Recommendations such as the British Thoracic Society establish the appropriate use of O2in health care.Our objective was to evaluate O2therapy procedures in anInternal Medicine ward, in light of 2017 British Thoracic Societyrecommendations.Methods: We conducted an observational study, during aperiod of 48 hours, which included patients admitted to the Internal Medicine ward of Hospital Central do Funchal, under oxygentherapy, with or without prescription. We analysed:1) the reason for the prescription,2) the type of prescription (fixed dose versus peripheral O2interval saturation oriented dose),3) accordance between prescription and administration, and4) monitoring (prescription and registration).Results: From a total of 116 hospitalized patients, 114 (98%)had O2prescription. Six patients (5.3%) had no hypoxemia, and57 (50%) had no hypoxemia assessment registration. From the114 patients with a prescription, only 38 (33%) had targeted saturation range objectives. Of these, 61% did not have prescribedthe maximum saturation target and only 8% had the two intervallimits defined. From 76 patients (67%) with fixed dose prescription, none had the registrations of the four recommended parameters. Eight (11%) did not receive O2 therapy and 39 (51%) werereceiving an O2dose different from the one prescribed. Monitoring was performed, on average, 2.16 times in a 24 hours period.Five patients (4%) had no monitoring record.Conclusion: The majority of O2therapy prescriptions did notmeet the current recommendations. Therefore, practice optimization is needed in the prescription, administration and monitoring of O2therapy steps. It is necessary to raise awareness amonghealth professionals and reprise outcome audition."

Medication discrepancies, together with the inexistence ofmedication reconciliation procedures that implement NationalHealth Department recommendations, lead to negative consequences as drug interactions, healthcare non-programmed admissions and to geriatric syndromes.Materials and Methods: The authors audited the prevalenceof medication reconciliation at discharge, analysing the pharmacological record and identifying discrepancies and errorsof medication. As a secondary endpoint, inward patients werecharacterized. Data was collected through computer recordconsultation as well as through patient or caregiver interview.Results: Median of age was 78 years and half of patientswere totally dependent. There was a 3.9 average of comorbidities, medication reconciliation was present in 47% and in 61%there was at least one medication discrepancy or error. Themedication error most frequently encountered was the introduction error.Discussion and Conclusion: The high prevalence of medication discrepancies and of non- medication reconciliation is inpart due to the inexistence of a systematic process for collecting pharmacological history, poor doctor-patient communication and the lack of medication reconciliation procedure. Thehigher prevalence of introduction errors may be due to copypaste of previous and out of date pharmacological records.There is a need for prospective studies that evaluate the medication reconciliation influencing factors, the medication errorsand its short and long-term consequences."

A rare but potentially serious adverse effect of statins’ therapy has been described– anti-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (anti-HMGCR) immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) – that can occur years after the drug has beenstarted. We conducted a literature review after illustratinga typical case of anti-HMGCR IMNM. A 67-year-old femaletreated with simvastatin for the past 5 years presented withproximal myalgias and tetraparesis, raised creatine kinase,a myopathic pattern on electromyogram, a necrotizing myopathy on muscle biopsy and anti-HMGCR antibodies. Thestatin was stopped, and immunosuppressive therapy wascommenced, leading to a complete remission. The distinction between anti-HMGCR IMNM and other myopathies iscrucial, so that the appropriate treatment can be startedpromptly. Likewise, it is important that clinicians be awareof this entity"

It ismainly characterized by neurological symptoms, such asparesthesias, incoherent speech, ataxia, dyspnoea, apnoea,which can culminate in death from respiratory paralysis. Toprevent this syndrome from taking place, periodic monitoringof paralytic shellfish poisoning biotoxins is mandatory beforebivalves are harvested for commercialization. However, ignorance or disrespect of the harvest bans in force has led tosporadic poisonings that required hospitalization. For severaldecades the occurrence of high contamination levels withthese biotoxins in bivalves of the Iberian Atlantic coast hasoccurred in decadal-like intervals. These years of very hightoxicity have coincided with years in which solar activity (derived from the 11-year sunspot cycle) is at its minimum. Theseasonality of this contamination is more severe in the autumn and known hospital admissions have also occurred inthe autumn."

The primary objective of thispaper was to assess the impact of the reduction or loss ofautonomy of the elderly patients in the nosocomial infectionacquisition.Material and Methods: Prospective analysis of hospitalizedpatients from March 2017 to February 2018 at the Department of Internal Medicine of Vila Real Hospital, with an evaluation of the dependence level through the Katz scale andnosocomial infection acquisition. Other variables were analyzed: compromised systems and risk factors in nosocomialinfections, mean duration of hospitalization, mortality and readmission.Results: A total of 1311 patients were analyzed, with a meanage of 83.2. Of the patients’ sample, 33.6% were autonomous, 32.6% were partially dependent and 33.7% were totally dependent. Nosocomial infection was observed in 10.6%of patients. There was a statistically significant associationbetween the dependence level and the nosocomial infections acquisition, as well as between the presence of nosocomial infection and mortality, and readmission after 30 days.The dependence level was also significantly associated withdays of hospitalization, with mortality and with readmission.Discussion and Conclusion: This study revealed that nosocomial infection development was superior in patients witha greater dependence level as well as the mortality, whichwas also higher in this subgroup of patients. In this way, theloss of autonomy should be considered as a predisposingpotential for acquisition of infection."

Prolonged hospitalizations were classified as appropriate if due to complex clinicalpresentation, complications or iatrogenies, and inappropriate if related to lack of post-discharge conditions.Results: One hundred and seventy seven prolonged hospitalizations (10.4% of all admissions); 53 men, mean age 76years. Average 33.8 days of hospitalization; 39% had previous clinical discharge – 1653 days of postponed discharge.At admission, 36% were partial and 17% totally dependent.Comorbidities: hypertension (75%), cerebrovascular disease(52%), diabetes (35%), dementia (28%). Prevalent main diagnoses: stroke (21%), pneumonia (14%), neoplasia (11%);14% required intensive/intermediate care units. In 64% thepreponderant prolongation factor was clinically appropriate- 77% due to complexity and 15% to nosocomial infections.Referred to the National Network of Integrated ContinuousCare were 23%. Mortality 13.0%. Thirty-six months post-discharge, 59% had been hospitalized, 23% had prolongedhospitalizations and 57 patients died - mortality rate of 37%in 3 years.Conclusion: Patients with prolonged hospitalizations are heterogeneous with respect to diagnosis and specific needs.Despite 36% of prolonged hospitalizations being caused bypost-discharge conditions, most were appropriate to the severity, clinical complexity or complications during the hospitalization."

TheModified Early Warning Score (MEWS) identifies patientsat high risk of clinical deterioration, admission to ICU andintra-hospital mortality when done at the Emergency Roomor at the ward. We tested MEWS as a predictor of early readmissions to the ICU when done at the moment of dischargefrom these Units.Material and Methods: We conducted a case-control study(1:1) comparing patients with early readmissions with controls without readmissions to a polyvalent ICU, during a period of 9 years. Logistic regression was used to determine thediscriminative power of MEWS to predict early readmissionsto the ICU. The predictive precision of the score was calculated by the area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve.Results: We paired 114 patients with early readmission (rateof 1.5%) with 114 controls. Any value of MEWS > 0 was associated with a significant increase in the risk of early readmission. A value of MEWS = 0 showed a negative predictivevalue of 99.7%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the MEWS to the prediction of early readmissions was 0.69 (IC95%: 0.62-0.76; p < 0.001).Discussion: The predictive precision of MEWS to this purpose was higher than other scores reported in the literature.Conclusion: MEWS is an easy clinical score with the potentialto increase patient safety at the moment of discharge fromthe ICU."

                    "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group ofmyeloid neoplasias, characterized by cytopenias stemmingfrom ineffective hematopoiesis and by an increased risk ofprogression to acute myeloid leukemia. They affect 5/100000 people per year in Portugal, among which more than60% will become transfusion-dependent during the courseof the disease. Cytopenias may lead to significant morbidityand their correct management is the key to maintain thesepatients’ quality of life. This document gathers the result ofthe debate promoted by the Anemia Working Group Portugalwith experts on the management of patients with lower riskMDS, addressing the medium- and long-term effects of recurrent transfusion and iron overload. For the diagnosis of MDS,the group recommends the use of World Health Organizationclassification published in 2016. The International PrognosisScoring System score is still the reference score to defineboth the prognosis and the therapeutic strategy. Supporttherapy is a fundamental cornerstone in the managementof MDS patients at any stage of the disease, and includesantibiotics, transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets, hematopoietic growth factors, antifibrinolytic agents and chelators.Chelation therapy should be considered in patients transfused with ≥ 20 units of erythrocytes or with serum ferritin ≥1000 ng/mL. Patients who are candidates to chelation shouldbe submitted to periodic magnetic resonance imaging to theliver and the pancreas. Therapeutic options should take intoaccount the individual characteristics of the disease for everypatient and preserve the quality of live, in accordance withinternational guidelines."

Chronic disease, oftenmultiple and complex, creates prolonged states of vulnerability and dependence on health professionals. This vulnerability comes from a set of listable, time-consuming andchangeable needs. This renewed sense of medical professionalism is based on new methodologies for the chroniccondition and complexity management. We discuss and prepare the concept of Individual and Integrated Care Plan as areconciliation of multiple plans responding directly to specific needs. Planning is patient-centered, circumscribed to itsintrinsic value as a human being of unrepeatable historicalrelevance, in its preferences and diversity, and projecting itinto the future, where its anticipated needs are bridged by aninterdisciplinary team. Implemented support is adjustable topatient / family status change. We consider this work tool tocreate a solid framework in approaching the frail and complex patients."

In this paper we analyzed the performance times in the first two years of the “codestroke” rapid access protocol patients undergoing fibrinolysis.Material and Methods: Prospective and observational studywith data from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2017. We performeddescriptive analysis and inferential statistics. The analysis included the door-to-doctor time (since the hospital admissionto the clinical evaluation), the door-to-computed tomography(CT) time (since the hospital admission to the CT scan completion) and the door-to-needle time (since the hospital admission to the fibrinolysis).Results: Thirty-eight fibrinolysis were carried out. The inferential analysis revealed no statistically significant differences. The median of the door-to-doctor time (00h06m versus00h07m) and door-to-CT time (00h32m versus 00h31m) weresimilar in both years. The door-to-needle time has improvedin the second year (median 1h15m versus 00h52m).Discussion: We have seen improvement in the door-to-needletime in the second year, fulfilling, in most cases, the timesrecommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The door-to-CT time does not comply withthese recommendations in none of the years.Conclusion: In the second year we improved the global performance. Measures will be adopted to reduce the door-toCT time"

The data about oncological inpatients with febrile neutropenia is scarce on literature, so this study pretends to characterize this population ina period of seven years at an internal medicine departmentand knowing more about this medical approach.Material and Methods: Observational cross-sectional studybetween January 2008 and December 2014 at an internalmedicine department. Oncological patients were included,with recent antineoplastic treatment hospitalized with diagnosis of febrile neutropenia. The clinical and demographicdata were collected based on medical records available onthe clinical process (in paper and in digital format).Results: 156 inpatients were included in a total of 187 hospitalizations by febrile neutropenia. More than 50% was man,with a median age of 67 years old and 63.0% had advancedoncological disease. Fewer was present in 85.6% of admissions and 39.0% had severe neutropenia. Blood cultureswere collected in 77.9% of episodes and 20.0% had bacteraemia. Gram-negative agents were the most frequent andthe antibiotic association had a downward trend, being thecarbapenems the most used. Mortality rate was about 17.0%,of which 62.5% had severe neutropenia and 75.0% stage IV.Conclusion: The creation of protocols and their auditingmake it possible to evaluate the clinical work performed onthe service and to improve the health care provided"

This study intends to evaluate the impactof the intervention of a palliative care (PC) team on the deprescription of potentially inappropriate drugs (PID).Methods: Retrospective observational study with adults withestimated survival of less than 6 months, followed by a PCteam at home, in 2016. The PID were quantified and their deprescription was evaluated, during the first year of follow-upby the team.Results: Sixty-eight patients were included, with a mean ageof 77 years. Fifty-seven (83.8%) were medicated with PID.Functional status did not influence the number of PID. Deprescription occurred in 40% of patients. The number of medical visits was the only variable with a statistically significantrelation with the deprescription (p = 0.004).Discussion: There was a high prevalence of PID in this sample, regardless of functional status. The data from this studyare in line with the current scientific literature, which suggeststhat a significant percentage of patients are medicated withdrugs with no proven benefit at this stage.Conclusion: It is essential to review the relevance of all end-of-life patients’ medication, due to the high prevalence of PIDand its consequences.

Score SAPS II and average Charlsonindex of 46 and 7, respectively. Twenty-two patients startednoninvasive mechanical ventilation at the Emergency Department, 6 at the unit and the remaining 6 at the InternalMedicine ward. Main reasons for its introduction: acute cardiogenic lung edema (50%) and acute chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (26%). The rate of therapeutic failure was29%. After 24 hours of noninvasive mechanical ventilation,the differences found between the response and the therapeutic failure group were statistically significant (pH 7.37vs 7.32; p <0.05). Ph variation in the first few hours seemsto be associated with a better ability to predict noninvasivemechanical ventilation response (0.894, p = 0.001).Conclusion: Noninvasive mechanical ventilation reduces patient morbi/mortality through close clinical and arterial gasimetry monitoring. pH variation seems to be the best predictor ofresponse, allowing early recognition of therapeutic failure andfacilitating the use of other therapeutic options in advance."

                    "In the diagnosis of patients with syncope it is important that theaetiology is correctly determined. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is essential in the evaluation of these patients, combining a meticulous clinical history with an appropriate physicalexamination and auxiliary diagnostic tests. However, even witha correct initial approach, many patients are misdiagnosed orremain undiagnosed, becoming then candidates for a prolonged follow-up. The implantable loop recorder (ILR) is asmall device that allows prolonged monitoring (up to 3 years)of the electric cardiac activity, increasing the likelihood of detecting a correlation between any cardiac rhythm alterationsand the patient’s symptoms. Thus, ILRs have assumed an increasing interest in this area since they allow the detection ofcardiac (arrhythmic) aetiology of much syncope that until thenremained with an unknown cause. The current guidelines recommend the use of ILRs in the early phase of the evaluation ofpatients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause, after initialevaluation, in the absence of high risk criteria and in the evaluation of high risk patients with syncope after initial negativeevaluation. This article is a systematic review that summarizesthe current knowledge about the utility and accuracy of ILR inthe diagnosis of syncope of unknown cause after a conventional diagnostic approach; as well as its utility in many specific situations (epilepsy, paediatrics, elderly, atrial fibrillation andcryptogenic stroke)."

                    "Heart failure (HF) is an epidemic syndrome of the 21st century, most often recognized in the elderly. The natural historyof chronic HF is characterized by its considerable symptomatic burden and recurrent acute decompensation leadingto repeated hospitalizations. Thus, HF is the main cause ofhospital admission and rehospitalizations, which translatesinto markedly high costs. Accordingly, in order to improveindividual outcomes and maintain the sustainability of thehealthcare system, it is fundamental to adequately treat HFand its common comorbidities. Recently, iron deficiency (ID)has been recognized in over 30% of HF patients, indicatinga more severe symptomatic burden, morbidity and mortalityrates, constituting a novel therapeutic target. Given the relevance of ID in HF, we ought to:1. Briefly discuss the main findings of trials comparingiron to placebo or control, namely the inefficacy of oral iron(IRONOUT HF) contrasting to the benefits of intravenous (IV)iron, which led to significant symptomatic improvement andpotentially reduced hospitalizations due to worsening HF, asdemonstrated in the main ferric carboxymaltose trials (FAIR--HF, CONFIRM-HF, EFFECT-HF);2. Propose a comprehensive rational algorithmic approachto ID in adequately selected HF patients;3. Emphasize the selection of candidates for IV iron basedon left ventricular ejection fraction, symptoms and haemoglobin concentration; and4. Review the main adverse effects of IV iron and currentgaps in knowledge. An algorithmic approach to ID in HF asan evidence-based intervention may result in optimal therapyfor selected patients, as well as decreased IV iron in inadequate scenarios"

                    "Fluid responsiveness has been a hot topic for some time.Although with an easy conceptual definition (responding tovolume expansion by increasing cardiac output), its practicalassessment has been the subject of research, debate andsome controversy, for the past 15 to 20 years. The problemis that fluid responsiveness is not the same as fluid benefit.And we have been wasting time researching in ways to predict fluid responsiveness. I really do not want to know if thepatient is fluid responsive or not (are not we all?), but ratherif fluid expansion is beneficial or detrimental to that specificpatient, on that specific moment. We test patients in shock forfluid responsiveness. If, whatever the method we use, we findthem to be responsive, we do intravenous fluids. We only stopfluid loading/fluid expansion if one of two things happen: if thepatient is no longer in shock, or if the patient is no longer fluid responsive. We would never use a drug with proven harm,especially if its benefit was insufficiently proven. Neverthelesswe continue to use fluids in scenarios in which their harm isproven, but their benefit is not. We need a paradigm shift. Weneed to stop looking for ways to predict fluid responsiveness.We must search for ways to identify which patients benefitfrom fluid expansion, fluid depletion or a neutral fluid strategy. New trials should prospectively compare well defined fluidstrategies (expansion, depletion or neutral) to be applied depending on a set of predetermined tests. Until then, we willend up with the same question: will this specific patient, at thisspecific moment, benefit from fluid expansion, fluid depletionor a neutral fluid strategy?"

                    "Introduction: Dolutegravir may be presented as a high efficiency level therapeutic option for naive or experimented patients, namely for simplifying therapies and achievement of agood interactions profile. Results of approval studies sustainit as safe and well tolerated. However, more recent studieshave raised doubts on its safety profile, for instance at theneuropsychiatric effects developing level.Our aim was to determine prevalence of neuropsychiatric effects or no neuropsychiatric effects on a HIV infected patientpopulation with dolutegravir on their antiretroviral therapy.Material and Methods: Transversal observational study of thecohort of patients followed at Oporto’s Hospital Immunodeficiency Department, subjected to dolutegravir therapy. After the introduction of dolutegravir, clinical files have beenbrowsed and questionnaires have been placed for evaluation of adverse effects.Results: Seventy patients have been identified as under dolutegravir therapy, of which 7 have been excluded for lackof data. Five patients were naive as to antiretroviral therapy.Prevalence rate for neuropsychiatric effects and other effects15 PUBLICAÇÃO TRIMESTRALVOL.26 | N.º 1 | JAN/MAR 2019ARTIGOS ORIGINAISwas 20.6% and 25.4%, respectively. The main neuropsychiatric effects were insomnia, nervousness/anxiety and depressive humor, more frequently observed on female patients[(34.6% vs 10.8% of the men); OR 4.37; CI 95% 1.17-16.27;p = 0.028]. Despite the results, therapy has not been discontinued.Conclusion: Observation of a high rate of neuropsychiatric effects (20.6%), similar to a recently published study. However,these neuropsychiatric effects did not lead to the discontinuation of dolutegravir therapy on any patient. In spite of the limited resources at their disposal for this study, the authorsstrongly stress the need for further studies and evaluations ofthe real impact of neuropsychiatric effects somehow associated to dolutegravir"

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program, 23.0.Results: Four hundred and fourteen (414) patients (50% men,mean age 68.77 years) were included. In this sample 76.5%were under insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy was present in21% diabetics, who were older and had higher waist circumference (WC) (p < 0.05). The mean HbA1c was 7.61% and itwas higher in women (p < 0.05). The mean body mass index(BMI) was 30.41 kg/m2. Grade 2 obesity and morbid obesitywas higher in women (p < 0.05). The mean WC was 107.24cm and was lower in patients with HbA1c between 7.1% and7.5% (p < 0.05). The mean waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was0,67. This value was higher in women, older patients andmore obese (p < 0.05). The patients treated with insulin hadhigher HbA1c, WC and WHtR values.Discussion and Conclusion: In this study women have worseglycemic and metabolic control. WC was associated withpoor control of HbA1c and lipodystrophy. Integrating theseparameters into the assessment and guidance of diabeticsmay be a useful tool."

The authors proposed toevaluate the prescription of PPIs as gastrointestinal bleedingprophylaxis during hospitalization of non-critically ill patients,including the indication and costs.Material and Methods: A prospective, observational, cross-sectional study. All patients admitted to our medical departmentduring a 31 day period were included. At the time of admission,a gastrointestinal bleeding risk score was completed by the attending physician. A score equal or greater than 10 points identified appropriateness of PPIs for prophylactic therapy. Costswith PPI use were collected on the study period.Results: During the study period, 115 patients were admitted,of which 99 were included in the study (54.5% women, meanage 76.2 years). Of the gastrointestinal bleeding risk factors assessed: 28.3% acute kidney injury, 10.1% liver disease, 20.2%sepsis, 40.4% prophylactic anticoagulation, and 30.3% coagulopathy. According to the score used, 67.7% of the patientswere in low or low-medium risk and 32.4% in high-medium orhigh risk. During hospitalization, 59.6% of the patients receivedPPIs, 45.8% of which inappropriately according to the riskscore. The total cost of PPIs use was 101.9€, with an inappropriate spending of 46.6€ during a 31 day period in our InternalMedicine department alone.Conclusions: PPIs use was prevalent in non-critically ill patients(59.6%), of which 45.8% were inappropriate, representing aproblem associated with iatrogenic risk and economic impact."

We report thecase of a woman who presented with flaccid tetraparesisand severe hypokalemia in which we have identified a novel probably disease-causing variant in the CACNA1S gene.After the diagnosis, the patient started acetazolamide treatment, resulting in a reduction in the intensity and number ofepisodes. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a rare causeof sudden muscle weakness. It may cause life-threateningrespiratory involvement and cardiac arrhythmias, so all theclinicians should be aware of this condition in order to recognize it quickly"

Mostauthors define this nephropathy as a form of acute kidney injury in the setting of an international normalized ratio (INR) ≥3 (concerning warfarin therapy) and in the absence of otheretiologies of acute kidney injury. Chronic kidney disease, despite not essential to the development of ARN, is one of itsstrongest risk factors. A kidney biopsy with glomerular hemorrhage, tubular obstruction with red blood cell casts and tubular epithelial cell lesion establishes the definitive diagnosisin the appropriate clinical setting. Treatment is essentially supportive, aiming the correction of excessive anticoagulation.However, renal function recovery is frequently incomplete. Recent studies emphasize new pathophysiological mechanisms,other than those related to glomerular hemorrhage. Direct oralanticoagulants have also recently been linked to ARN. Herein,the authors review the literature about ARN and underline theimportance of this increasingly recognized but probably stillunderdiagnosed entity, so as to improve close monitoring ofchronic kidney disease patients treated with oral anticoagulants."

The non-random sample was composed of 663 subjects, of both genders, varying from 15 to 64 years old. The association between RP’s prevalence and age, gender, marital status, county of residence, profession, occupational exposure to chemical products, vibratory tools and refrigeration systems was investigated. Participants were classified as having RP based on UK Scleroderma Study Group criteria (“A” criteria) and Maricq’s scale of distal finger color (“A+B” criteria). Data were analyzed using the chi-square and McNemar tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.",

Only occupational exposure to chemical products was significantly and positively associated with RP. Pallor fingers were the most reliable symptom of RP, regardless the criteria used.",

They were assessed in two 3-year periods with a 20-year hiatus (1/1/1992-31/12/1994: 10 817 episodes and 1/1/2012-31/12/2014: 17 535 episodes).

The internist should be able to ensure comfort care at the end of life of the patients he is attending. The study objective was to analyze the therapy performed and complementary diagnostic tests (CDT) requested within 48 hours before death. Methods: Retrospective observational study with 100 consecutive deaths (from patients with “do not resuscitate indication”) occurring in the Internal Medicine Service for a year. Results: The length of stay was 9.4 ± 7.9 days, the age 86.5 ± 9.9 years, with no gender differences. It was found that 71.0% of patients had at least one CDT application. CDTs included blood tests (54.0%), blood cultures (17.0%), radiographs (19.0%), ultrasound scans (8.0%) or computerized axial tomography (2.0%). They were prescribed: nebulizations (76.0%), antibiotic therapy (74.0%, being 44.6% broad spectrum), low molecular weight heparin (71.0%), nonopioid analgesics (53.0%), among others. In 28.0% of cases there was no prescribed analgesia. The opioid prescription rate was 19.0%. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in the care of vulnerable patients. Medicine should not always have a healing glow, but it must always take care, respecting the cultural, clinical and ethical values of the doctor-patient relationship. The internist should in end-of-life patients improve their symptomatic control and avoid the use of inappropriate CDTs without any added benefit to the human person."

Some estimates indicate that the incidence of the APS is around 5 new cases per 100 000 persons per year and the prevalence around 40-50 cases per 100 000 persons. The aPL are positive in approximately 13% of patients with stroke, 11% with myocardial infarction, 9.5% of patients with deep vein thrombosis and 6% of patients with pregnancy morbidity. Currently, there is consensus in treating APS patients with thrombosis with long-term oral anticoagulation and to prevent obstetric manifestations with the use of aspirin and heparin. This review summarizes the main knowledge on the clinical and therapeutic aspects of this syndrome."

After the initial usage, in the beginning of the 80’s for the evaluation of abdominal trauma, the POCUS became a daily practice in the critical patient evaluation, either in Critical Care Units or in Emergency Departments, assuming, nowadays, an important role of a large variety of clinical protocols. In this review, the authors propose to revise the established applications of POCUS and point out its practical consequences in medical daily routines as well as reaffirm the importance that it can and must have in pre- and post-graduated medical education. The authors strongly believe that the competences hereby presented will, shortly, be included in the core competences of internal medicine."

Recent discussions about end of life issues showed that health care professionals, media and most of the citizens use incorrect words, with inappropriate meanings, incorrectly related to wrong concepts. In this context and assuming that communication is the basis of the good clinical relation it is urgent to clarify concepts and proper words for current practice to spare misunderstandings and wrong decisions. Authors have assumed the need of profound debate on proper words and correct concepts in clinical practice and current communication in Portuguese, so this text pretends to contribute to that clarification."

Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA) represents an advance in the treatment of ischemic stroke and its use in the elderly > 80 years old was a recent target of discussion.Material and Methods: A retrospective study was performed in the 2010-2015 period that included patients >80 years old with ischemic stroke who underwent IV-rtPA. The study evaluated demographic and clinical variables, occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation and prognosis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.Results: We included 45 patients, mean age 84.4 years old and female predominance (62.2%). The main risk factors were arterial hypertension (68.9%) and cardioembolism (62.2%). In most cases, IV-rtPA was performed until 3 hours (82.2%). hemorrhagic transformation occurred in 22.2%, with worse prognosis at 3 months (p = 0.000). Lower severity of stroke and length of hospital stay were associated with better prognosis at 3 months (p = 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively).Discussion: Some of these results are in agreement with data from other studies. The increase in age is associated with a worse prognosis. hemorrhagic transformation is one of IV-rtPA concerns. The incidence of arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation increases with age, both associated with an increased risk of stroke.Conclusion: The safety of IV-rtPA has been demonstrated in several studies. Age should not be an exclusion criterion, since properly selected patients may benefit from such therapy."

This study aimed to characterize patients with microbiologic isolation of ESBL-producing strains in a tertiary hospital.Material and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out from the 1st of January to the 30th of June 2014 and included all cases of ESBL producing bacteria isolation in hospitalized adults, in all departments of the Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto. Risk factors, clinical characteristics and treatment options were evaluated.Results: A total of 132 isolates of ESBL producing strains were included. Most patients with ESBL-producing bacteria had an invasive device (58.3%, n = 77). Isolation of the ESBL-producing bacteria occurred, on average, at the 21st day of hospitalization. Part of the patients (19.7%, n = 26) had previous history of ESBL producing strain isolation and 65.2% (n = 86) had been or were under antibiotics at the time of isolation. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated agent (71.2%, n = 94) and uroculture was the microbiological product with the highest isolation rate (62.1%, n = 82). The mortality rate was 6.8% (n = 9).Conclusion: The analysis of these data underlines the importance of identifying colonized patients with ESBL-producing strains and the impact of inadequate antibiotic therapy in the dissemination and persistence of these agents"

                    "Introduction: The unique characteristics of a stroke patient, due to the sudden onset of severe functional impairment, as well as prognostic uncertainty, increase the necessity of a timely Palliative Care approach. Our objective was to analyze the profile of stroke patients to whom In-Hospital Palliative Care and Support Team evaluation was requested.Methods: Retrospective observational study with a sample composed of all patients admitted with primary diagnosis of stroke in a tertiary hospital, with Team evaluation request, over a period of 5 years (2012-2016).Results: A total of 48 patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 79.6 years (± 13.1), 24 female. There were 41 ischemic strokes, with mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission of 18.1 (± 6.5), and 7 cerebral hemorrhages. Evaluation requests were aimed at care organization (89.6%) and decision-making (70.8%), and for symptomatic control: respiratory (58.3%), gastrointestinal (31.3%) and uncontrolled pain (25.0%). At the time of the first evaluation, the mean Palliative Performance Scale 12.2 (± 8,1). Dyspnea (52.6%) and bronchorrhea (50.0%) were the most prevalent symptoms and aspiration pneumonitis themost common complication (67.4%). Opioid treatment was started in 45.7% and antimuscarinic in 34.8%. In-hospital mortality was 72.9% (n = 35), with 71.4% of deaths occurring on the first 30 days post-event.Discussion and Conclusion: Due to the complexity and prevalence of uncontrolled symptoms in this type of patients, it is clear that acute neurological events often result in severe functional impairment, reducing both quality of life and life expectancy. These are, therefore, unequivocally patients in need of swift access to Palliative Care."

For patients transported to HDFF, the presumptive diagnosis made by the pre-hospital emergency teamwas analyzed. We also looked at the relationship betweentransportation with a doctor and the priority given in triage bythe Manchester triage system. In addition, we assessed thedestination of the patient following medical examination, themain characteristics of cardio-respiratory arrests and the activation of stroke and myocardial infarction code performedby the team.Conclusion: There are various conclusions to be taken fromthis detailed analysis. Perhaps the most relevant is the invaluable role of the team in diminishing the morbimortalityof patients with suspected myocardial infarction and stroke,when these codes were activated."

This study evaluated the impact of these drugs on patients’ lives and analyzed the factors responsible for a better response to treatment.Material and Methods: Retrospective study of 80 patients diagnosed with RA and treated with biological drugs between January 2004 and April 2015 in Hospital Senhora de Oliveira, Guimarães (Portugal). Patients were retrospectively evaluated before and 6 months after biological treatment.Results: A total of 80 patients with RA were analyzed, 62 women (77.5%) and 18 men (22.5%), with a mean age of 45.5 (± 13.0) years. About 67.1% of the patients were positive for rheumatoid factor and 55.4% were positive for anti-citrulline antibodies. There was an association between the positivity of these antibodies and RA diagnosis (p ≤ 0.001). Etanercept was the biological drug used in most patients (75.9%). Fifteen (18.8%) patients discontinued the biological drug and 19 (24.1%) switched to another. In 6 months of biological treatment, patients had a significant reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, in C-reactive protein levels and in Disease Activity Score (DAS28), which decreased from 4.91 ± 1.31 to 2.53 ± 1.10 (p ≤ 0.001).Discussion: The results confirm the many benefits of biological drugs in patients with RA.Conclusion: Biological drugs significantly reduce the level of disease activity, inflammatory parameters and symptoms of patients with RA."

We describe the case of a 37-year-old woman whose ischemic stroke was the presentation form of isolated left ventricular noncompaction. She underwent thrombolysis with complete reversal of the deficits. ILVNC was detected in the study, in addition to patent foramen ovale. The cardioembolism was admitted as the cause of the stroke, leading to the decision of oral hypocoagulation. We emphasize ILVNC as an uncommon etiology of stroke and the importance of the etiological study of stroke in young patients, because it influences the therapeutic decision and the prognosis."

                    "The incidence of stroke in young adults has been increasing in recent decades, resulting in more and more hospitalizations. Likewise, the weight of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity and sedentary lifestyle seems to be increasing, in detriment of other rarer risk factors, classically associated with stroke in this age group. The list of possible etiologies is extensive and the identification of risk factors does not lead to a complete etiological understanding of stroke. Therefore, the approach to this pathology requires not only the adequate use of complementary diagnostic tests but also hierarchical thinking. In this article, the authors present a review of the risk factors and etiologies of stroke in the young adult, focusing on some clinical and diagnostic aspects that are useful for the etiological investigation of these patients in clinical practice."

The authors aim to review these hyperthermic drug-induced syndromes, their differential diagnosis, possible treatments, as well as the deleterious effects of sustained hyperthermia, evidencing their neurological consequences.

                    "Introduction: Clostridium difficile infection has worryingly increased in incidence, severity and relapse rates.Methods: An 18-month retrospective analysis was carriedout based on the clinical records of patients with confirmedinfection hospitalized in Beatriz Ângelo Hospital, Portugal.Subjects were divided into two groups: ‘primary-infection’and ‘relapse’. The following clinical characteristics were assessed: age, gender, community versus hospital acquiredinfection, previous antibiotic therapy, proton-pump inhibitors use, severity criteria (namely, > 65 years, leukocytes >20 000/uL and creatinine > 1.5 above baseline), antibioticsused, duration of antibiotic therapy, hospital length-of- stayand mortality.Results: Overall severity was higher in primary-infections(leukocytes > 20 000/uL 21.3% vs 12.0%, creatinine> 1.5from baseline 38.3% vs 20.8%), as were patient’s mortalityrates (23.4% vs 4.0%). Although vancomycin is recommended – in monotherapy or in association with metronidazole – insevere disease, our study showed that in patients with primary-infection plus 2 or 3 severity criteria, metronidazole alonewas the most frequent choice (46.2% if 2 criteria present and57.1% if 3 criteria present). In recurrent infections vancomycin was the initial choice even in less severe cases (100.0%if no criteria and 68.8% if 1 criteria present). Proton-pumpinhibitors use was higher in relapses (84.0% vs 65.2%).Conclusion: This study suggests that primary-infectionscomprise greater clinical severity and mortality; emphasizesthe importance of a severity scoring system to assure appropriate antibiotic regimens and supports the idea that proton-pump inhibitors might be a risk factor."

The authors characterize and evaluate the prevalence of spondylodiscitis in a Department of Internal Medicine (DIM).Population/Methods: Observational retrospective study of allpatients with spondylodiscitis diagnosis at discharge from2007 to 2016. Demographic variables, presentation symptoms, risk factors, site of infection, etiology and managementwere accessed.Results: Thirty three cases of spondylodiscitis (19 men, meanage 77 ± 15.5 years) were identified, performing a prevalenceof 0.3%. The more frequent symptoms at presentation wereflank pain, fever and neurological disorders. Twelve patientshad concomitant infection, eight diabetes mellitus and fourcancer. Four patients undergone surgery < 6 months, threehad chronic hepatic disease and one was an intravenousdrug consumer. Twenty-five patients had elevated leukocytecount and/or RCP. Twenty-one patients underwent magneticresonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)scan, six only MRI, four only CT scan and one only positronemission tomography. Fifteen patients underwent biopsy.The most frequent location was the lumbar spine at L4-S1. In11 patients blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coliESBL, Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) ormethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and inone biopsy identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The antibiotic scheme was vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for patientswith MRSA and negative cultures, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin for patients with E. coli ESBL,flucloxacillin for patients with MSSA. The average duration oftreatment was 5 weeks.Conclusion: Patients with spondylodiscitis are older patientswith co-morbidities. Imagiologic studies are essential for diagnosis as symptoms and laboratory changes may be absent."

The destruction of RBC may resultfrom intravascular or extravascular hemolytic phenomena.The last one is most often associated with autoimmune phenomena, chemical/drug toxicity, infections, hypersplenismand mechanical destruction.The objective of the study was to describe the demographiccharacteristics, main causes and clinical characteristics ofpatients with extrinsic hemolytic anemia.Methods: A retrospective study between January 2010 andDecember 2014 of patients with HA who were hospitalized inan Internal Medicine Service of a Central Hospital. Hemolyticmarkers were evaluated.Results: A total of 22 patients with a mean age of 67.6 (±17.9 years) were included; 54,5% were male. About 81.8%had a positive direct antiglobulin test and the rest a negativeone. Between patients with auto-immune hemolytic anemia,61.1% were associated with infections. At the time of diagnosis, the average value of Hb was 7.5 g/dL, requiring onaverage, 9.8 days reaching values above 9 g/dL. For thetreatment, 36.4% of patients did corticotherapy, 22.7% corticotherapy in association with transfusion of red blood cellsand 13.6% only transfusion, beyond the treatment of the underlying cause. The mortality rate was 9%.Conclusion: Hemolytic anemia. can result from many causesand the majority result from infectious processes. The identification of the underlying cause of hemolysis is extremely important for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. There isa low mortality rate and the prognosis depends on the underlying cause but the risk increases in elderly patients."

Recently published statistical data shows that thepopulation aged 100 years or over has shown a strong increase in Portugal. However, there are few studies characterizing such an elderly population which almost invariably isadmitted to hospital at some point.Methods: A retrospective study of patients aged 100 years orover hospitalized in the department of Internal Medicine from01/01/2006 to 31/12/2016.Results: In the period under analysis, there were 172 admissions (< 0.4% of the total) corresponding to 130 patients. Theaverage age was 101.1 years, with 74.4% of the patients being female. A percentage of 51.7% of the patients came fromtheir domiciles, and the degree of dependence for daily lifeactivities evaluated as being “totally dependent” in 60.5% ofcases. Analysis of the personal histories revealed that 46.7%of patients had 2 or 3 comorbidities, with arterial hypertension, heart failure and dementia being the most prevalent.Polypharmacy was present in 41.8% of patients. Infectiouspathology of the respiratory system stood out as the reasonfor hospitalization (57.6%) and as the direct cause of death(52.1%). A mortality rate of 41.3% was found.Conclusion: Hospital admissions for centenarian patientshave been steadily increasing over the years, and these aregenerally associated with a worsening degree of functional dependency and, consequently, higher socioeconomiccosts. This study made it possible to better characterize thispopulation in order to adopt more appropriate responses tothese hospitalizations."

The authors aimed tocharacterize a group of patients with DM and to analyze theirvascular risk factors, metabolic profile, and the therapeuticstrategies used.Material and Methods: In this retrospective observationalstudy, 300 patients with DM who had been followed in Diabetology visits for three years were randomly included. Datawere collected in the first and last visit in that period, using Sclínico®. Excel® and SPSS® were used for the statisticalanalysis.Results: The median age of the patients was 65 years, 61.7%were male, and 83.3% had been diagnosed with type 2 DM.During the analyzed period, the median hemoglobin A1C decreased from 8.2% to 7.2%, with a stable body-mass index,and the antidiabetic therapy was intensified. Regarding theremaining vascular risk factors, 72.7% of the patients hadarterial hypertension, 62.7% had dyslipidemia, 42.7% wereobese, 38.7% were sedentary, and 9.3% were smokers.Moreover, 83% of the patients had LDL> 70 mg/dL. The mostcommon macrovascular complication was coronary heartdisease (14.0%), the most frequent microvascular complication was nephropathy (30.7%) and globally, the mediancreatinine clearance was of 84.3 mL/min. The median globalcardiovascular risk was high (27.7%), even though 77.0% ofthe patients were taking hypolipidemic drugs, 72.6% antihypertensive drugs, 41.3% anti-platelet aggregation drugs,and 4.0% oral anticoagulation drugs.Conclusion: The patient’s metabolic profile showed a favorable progression, with the intensification and adjustment ofantidiabetic therapies playing an important role."

Endoscopic studies revealed diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin M and kappa light chains in the mucosa of the small intestine. Later, on evaluation in the Haemato-Oncology clinic, the risk of death at 5 years was considered low, and thus no further therapeutic measures were proposed. The patient remained stable for three years, when she developed septic shock with rapidly progressive multiple organ failure and died a few hours after admission to hospital. The authors describe the case and elaborate a review of the literature on this pathology. We draw attention to this rare manifestation of an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder to be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient with a malabsorption syndrome."

This article aims to review the main physiological effects of the technique and the studies that support its use in diverse underlying conditions. Due to its excellent tolerability and efficacy in cases of hypoxemic respiratory failure, it may become a first-line indication in special situations like pneumonia, in immunocompromised patients, patients with do-not-intubate orders or as an aid in invasive ventilation weaning. Some promising studies have also demonstrated a good clinical response with the use of this technique in patients with respiratory failure from other causes and outside the Intensive Care Unit. Hence, it seemsto be a viable alternative to non-invasive ventilation, with potential applicability in a vast group of patients of the Internal Medicine field of action."

                    "Introduction: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a non-intrusiveform of ventilatory support, with proven benefits in severalclinical conditions. The objective was to assess NIV indications in patients with respiratory insufficiency and to identifypredictors of NIV response.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinicalprocesses of patients undergoing NIV, admitted to InternalMedicine, between January and December 2014.Results: Study included 54 patients, with a mean age of82.2 years (± 8.4). Forty-four patients had pathologies thatare considered indications, with established evidence of theneed of NIV: 33 (75.0%) had heart failure, five (11.4%) acuteexacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, four(9.1%) obesity hypoventilation syndrome and two (4.5%) severe immunocompromised pneumonia. The failure rate was20.5%. In the remaining 10 patients, NIV was used in severeimmunocompetent pneumonia, septic shock and benzodiazepine intoxication, with a failure rate of 70.0%. There wasa statistically significant improvement in gasometer parameters two hours after NIV in patients demonstrating clear evidence for the need of NIV and in patients in whom there wasno failure of this ventilatory modality.Conclusion: In our sample the failure rate of NIV was significantly lower in patients who complied with the formal indications for the initiation of this type of ventilation. Thus, despitethe increasing use of NIV, careful patient selection is an essential step in its success. The best predictor of NIV successwas good response after 1 to 2 hours of therapy"

It frequently involvesthe expansion of CD8+ cells, which may lead to cytopeniasand often correlates with autoimmune disorders. Anotherform is the CD4+ LGL leukemia, which behaves more indolently but may associate with other neoplasia.Material and Methods: Retrospective and descriptive analysis of the 14 patients diagnosed with T-cell LGL leukemia inour center between 2002 and 2016, regarding gender/age;clinical presentation; immunophenotype; frequency of cytopenias; coexistent malignancies; autoimmune disorders andtemporal relationship between both diagnosis; immunosuppressant treatment and its outcome.Results: Three patients had CD4+ LGL leukemia and elevenhad CD8+ LGL leukemia. In the latter, neutropenia was theprevailing cytopenia (63.6%), followed by anemia (45.5%)and thrombocytopenia (36.4%). The most common symptoms were fatigue and recurrent bacterial infections; 35.7%presented with asymptomatic cytopenias. From patients withCD4+ LGL leukemia, one had colorectal cancer. Prevalenceof autoimmune diseases was 35.7%; its diagnosis precededthe identification of LGL leukemia in all patients. Five patientsrequired treatment; methotrexate was the most selected firstline immunosuppressant. Complete hematological responsewas achieved in two cases. Mortality rate was 14.3% at amedian follow-up time of 2 years.Discussion and Conclusion: Clinical presentation and frequency of cytopenias were close to described in previousstudies. The recurrent association with autoimmunity suggests the existence of common etiopathogenic features;chronic autoantigen stimulation might play a role in the onsetof the clonal disease. Further studies are needed for determining the gold-standard approach of LGL leukemia."

The goal of thisstudy was to evaluate the compliance of pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE in an Internal Medicine Department(IMD). This evaluation was based on a VTE risk assessmentguide that was established as quality indicator.Material and Methods: Observational cross-sectional studybetween 2010 and 2016. The patients admitted to IMD onthe first Friday of each month were included and hypocoagulated or absent patients on the third day of hospitalizationwere excluded. VTE risk assessment registry and prescription of prophylaxis on admission (D0) and on the third day(D3) were monitored. Adequacy rate of VTE prophylaxis (ratio between the number of patients undergoing appropriateprophylaxis and the total number of patients included) wascalculated annually in D0 and D3.Results: A total of 569 patients were selected and 149 wereexcluded. Of the 420 patients included, 403 were consideredat risk. Of these, 93.3% had a risk assessment registered inthe clinical process at admission. Fifty-four patients had acontraindication for pharmacological prophylaxis. Of the 349patients eligible for prophylaxis, 86.8% had adequate prescription on admission. There were few prescribing errors. InD0 the adequacy rate of pharmacological prophylaxis was88.1% and in D3 87.6%.Conclusion: The risk assessment registry is widespread inIMD with a very considerable high percentage of pharmacological prophylaxis adequacy. The establishment of clinicalguides and their systematic auditing allow a better understanding of reality and increase good practice, improvinghealth organization."

The objective of this studywas to evaluate vitamin D status in patients with RA and toassess the relationship between vitamin D levels and pain.Methods: In a cohort of 45 patients with RA, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels, parathyroid hormone, C-reactiveprotein (CRP) and albumin levels were measured. Diseaseactivity was evaluated by calculating the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28).Results: Forty five patients were included in the study. Thirtyone patients were in remission, 11 patients had painful jointsand the median VAS pain score was 30. Out of the 45 patients, 41 had vitamin D levels below 30 ng/mL. Levels of25(OH)D3 were not found to be correlated to the DAS28score (p = 0.59), the VAS pain score (p = 0.55) or CRP (p =0.16). Parathyroid hormone levels were positively correlatedto CRP (p = 0.01).Conclusion: In our study, it appears that vitamin D deficiencyis highly prevalent in patients with RA but it is not linked todisease severity or pain experienced in RA. PTH levels arerelated to CRP and but not to the number of painful jointsor VAS pain score. This relationship may reflect uncontrolleddisease or be a reflection of physiological vitamin deficiency.Vitamin D supplementation may be needed both for the prevention of osteoporosis as well as for better disease controlin patients with RA and low levels of vitamin D and high CRP"

Laboratory tests showed leucocytosis (16100/uL),elevated C-reactive protein (52.7 mg/dL), high sedimentationrate (130 mm/h) and hepatic cytolysis. Hepatic nodules, suspicious of secondary/primary lesions were observed by computerized tomography. Alpha-fetoprotein and serotypes forhepatotropic viruses were negative. Streptococcus viridanswas isolated in the blood cultures and targeted antibiotictherapy was started. Fever disappeared but hepatic lesionsremained. Increased level of serum IgG4 (188 mg/dL) wasobserved. The liver biopsy showed myofibroblast proliferation with storiform pattern, suggesting LIP, and IgG4+ plasmocytes. Steroid therapy was initiated successfully. The diagnosis of IgG4 related LIP is rare, however, the prognosis isusually good after a course of steroid therapy"

The authorspresent the AGE project for Geriatric Structured Assessment,developed in an Internal Medicine Service of PortoHospital Center.Methods: The AGE project was characterized by the applicationof a vulnerability screening scale (VES-13) to allhospitalized elderly patients followed by a quality indicatorchecklist. These quality indicators were selected from theconsensus document Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders-3(ACOVE-3), applied to this reality and supported by assessmenttools such as the Mini-Cog and the Mini Mental StateExamination (MMSE). In a second phase of the project leafletsrelated to common problems in home care of vulnerableelders were developed with the nursing teams for teachingthe patient and/or caregiver. Likewise, we have included achecklist of medical discharge conditions, one for professionalsand another for the patient.Results: The authors present the first quarter results of theproject implementation, which included 543 elderly patients.The VES-13 scale was applied to 300 of these patients ant237 (79.0%) of them were identified as vulnerable elderlypatients. Eighty tree patients (35.0%) were screened for dementiaand 24 (52.2%) new cases of suspected dementiawere identified.Conclusion:The authors conclude that the AGE project is astrategy for the quality improvement in hospitalized geriatricpatients changing the behavior of the health care team."

                    "Introduction: Esophageal varices (EV) are a complicationof portal hypertension, and its rupture is associated witha high mortality rate. The use of non-invasive diagnosticmethods, including hepatic elastography, have been underinvestigation.Aim: Evaluate the usefulness of transient hepatic elastographyas a non-invasive test for the prediction of presenceof EV, to avoid systematic screening with esophagogastroduodenoscopyin a selected group of patients.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the patientsof our Hepatology Unit with a hepatic elastography value >13kPa who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy within18 months of its evaluation.Results: We included 259 patients (80.7% males), with amedium age of 57.9 ± 9.8 years; 65.3% had EV (52.1%grade II-III). We built ROC curves correlating hepatic elastographyvalue and presence of EV, and obtained an areaunder the curve (AUC) for presence of EV of 0.755 (cut-off>26.6 kPa, sensitivity 81.1%, specificity 64.4%) and AUCof 0.68 (cut-off > 28,1 kPa, sensitivity 82.9%, specificity49.7%) for grade II-III EV. For viral cirrhosis we obtainedAUC of 0.83 for presence of EV (cut-off > 19.8 kPa, sensitivity95.4%, specificity 62.2%) and AUC of 0.69 for gradeII-III EV (cut-off > 19.8 kPa, sensitivity 94.7%, specificity42.0%). In patients without splenomegaly or thrombocytopenia,AUC was 0.89 (cut-off > 26.6 kPa, sensitivity 86.3%,specificity 81.8%) for presence of EV and 0.75 (cut-off >26. 6kPa, sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 60.6%) for grade IIIII EV.Conclusion: Hepatic elastography values and presence ofEV were related, with a higher significance in the groups ofviral cirrhosis and those without splenomegaly or thrombocytopenia. Cut-off points had high sensitivity, illustrating thepotential utility of transient hepatic elastography in identifyingpatients who may not need to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy."

                    "Introduction: Nailfold capillaroscopy is a simple, safe andnoninvasive method, essential in the evaluation of the microcirculationin vivo, and crucial to distinguish betweenprimary or secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon. Raynaud’sphenomenon assumes its major importance in the spectrumof systemic sclerosis diseases showing the early involvementand the vascular changes in the microcirculationbefore the onset of other clinical symptoms or organinvolvement, and creating an opportunity to prevent vascularcomplications.Methods: We analyzed, retrospectively, clinical data andresults of nailfold capillaroscopy from 110 patients followedup at an autoimmune disease consultation, mainly female.Results: The main reason for performing Nailfold capillaroscopywas the study of Raynaud’s phenomenon,mainly secondary cases (67.4%), being the most frequentunderlying pathology the systemic sclerosis. Significantchanges were not found in the capillaries architecture in27.3% (n = 30). In the remaining, we found minor changesin 28 cases, presence of megacapillaries in 41 patients(37.3%), avascular areas in 35 (37.8%), microhemorrhagesin 36 patients (32.7%) and signs of neoangiogenesis in five(4.5%). The majority of systemic sclerosis patients havesecondary Raynaud’s. Only two patients with systemicsclerosis did not have a well-defined scleroderma patternin the nailfold capillaroscopy.Conclusion: The nailfold capillaroscopy effectiveness onearly diagnosis of systemic sclerosis, on monitoring diseaseprogression and in the prediction of organ involvement,making it an essential noninvasive method, assupported by its inclusion in the systemic sclerosis classificationcriteria."

Themean length of hospital stay was 8.7 days and most patientscame from the emergency department. The pluripathology,the polypharmacy and the increasing complexity of the admittedpatients were highlighted. The most common diagnosiswas community-acquired pneumonia. There were littleintercurrence during hospitalization and in 22 cases (7.8%)there was a need to return to the hospital. The majority ofpatients were referred to outpatient hospital after discharge,and the clinical stability prevailed at 30 days post-discharge.Conclusion: This model of hospital admission has demonstratedthe potential to embrace more and more patients,and the experience of the first Portuguese unit will certainlycontribute to the expansion to other hospitals in the country."

Thrombophilia testing was negative,however isolated alkaline phosphates elevation (10 times superiorto the upper reference limit) was detected. Alkalinephosphatase elevation that does not surpass twice the upperreference limit during the third trimester of pregnancy isconsidered normal. Elevation beyond those levels requiresdifferential diagnosis with liver, bone and renal disease.Off-label anti-thrombotic therapy was offered during the entirepregnancy, which carried on.

We will not refer any scientific domainbecause, in this case, the same rational could be applied to different scientific and professional fields, from Law to Engineeringor Economy, from Medicine to Social Sciences.Based on the claim that the main outcome of a PhD process is the PhD degree holder, not the thesis, we present the project of NOVA (Universidade Nova de Lisboa) Doctoral School as a complementary training project in a wide range of transversal professional and personal competences offered to the PhD students of NOVA’s nine Academic Units (Schools and Institutes)."

                    "Introduction: In Portugal, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects around 14.2% of those older than 40 years. Internal Medicine plays a role in the hospitalized CODP exacerbation patient care. Our objective was to characterize the COPD exacerbation patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward focusing on adverse outcome predictors.Methods: An observational retrospective study retrieved data from three consecutive years. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed assuming the all-cause in-hospital death outcome.Results: The sample comprised 280 cases. The mean age was 76.0 years and 53.6% were male. At admission, depressed mental status was evident in 21.8% and hypotension in 3.6%. Thirty six percent were acidemic and 64.3% were hypercapnic. A hemoglobin value below 10.0 g/dL was found in 4.6%, eosinopenia in 20.4%, and creatininemia above 2.0 mg/dL in 6.0%. Ten percent had atrial fibrillation. Twenty-nine patients died in the hospital (10.4%). We identified the following predictors: admission in the previous90 days (OR 4.7; p = 0.006), atrial fibrillation (OR 5.0; p = 0.002), systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg (OR 3.7; p = 0.023), eosinopenia (OR 2.7; p = 0.034) and hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (OR 5.1; p = 0.026) and creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL (OR 3.8; p = 0.048). Absence of predictors at admission was linked to a low risk profile.Conclusion: Compared to the overall COPD exacerbation patient, those admitted to an Internal Medicine tend to be older and to have higher degree of comorbidity. The identified predictors can be linked to the COPD exacerbation pathophysiology."

High level of clinical suspicion and appropriate laboratorytesting interpretation are essential for the diagnosis.The aim of this study was to review the admissions attributableto brucellosis in a public hospital of an endemic region of Portugal.Methods: Retrospective observational study of consecutivehospital admissions with a discharge diagnosis of brucellosisbetween 2000 and 2012, by the analysis of epidemiological,clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features.Results: A total of 36 patients were included. The percentageof male patients was 69.4%, with mean age of 52.9 years oldand 72.2% presented a risk factor exposure for brucellosis.We found 14 admissions in 2000 and zero admissions in 2012.The most reported frequent symptoms were fever (72%), myalgia(58.3%) and asthenia (47.2%). The rose bengal test waspositive for the majority of the tested patients (91.7%). On theother hand, only one patient had a positive culture for brucellosis.The disease was essentially acute (75%) and focalized(69%). When focalized, osteoarticular involvement wasthe most frequent presentation (37%). In univariate analysis,patients who relapsed (16.6%) showed no significant associationwith any of the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory ortherapeutic features (p > 0.05). Antibiotic regimen most oftenprescribed was rifampicin plus doxycycline (55.5%).Conclusion: In our study, hospital admissions due to brucellosisdropped dramatically between 2000 and 2012, whichshows an optimistic sign of disease control. Acute and focalizedforms of the disease were the most frequent manifestationsof this zoonosis that is still a challenge for clinicians."

The importance of recanalizationis controversial but it is related to residual symptoms/ signs. This study aims to calculate the incidence of CVT, to evaluatethe importance of recanalization and to define its predictive factors.Material and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study involving patients with CVT diagnosed between 2004 to 2014 in Braga Hospital. Functional assessment was based on the modified Rankin scale. Recanalization was defined as thepresence of venous flow in all vessels, including residual. A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted and used test t Student(t), Mann-Whitney U(U), chi-square(χ2) or Fisher’s exact test a binary logistic regression was used for predictive model. It wasrecognized statistical significance p < 0.05.Results: The incidence of CVT was estimated at 1.82 cases per 100 000 person-years. The recanalization was associated with the functional evaluation at 6 (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.001, φc =0.511) and 12 months (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.001, φc =0.480), inability to six (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.024,φ = 0.305) and 12 months (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.023,φ = 0.305), and the residual symptoms/signals at 3 months (χ2(1) = 23.46, p < 0.001,φ = 0.605). The obtained regression model included the following predictive variables age, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, altered state of consciousness and new residual symptoms/signs. This was statistically significant (χ2(5) = 37.43, p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 70.8%. New residual symptoms/signs is the best predictor of no recanalization (OR = 33.33).Discussion and Conclusion: The recanalization has an important role in prognosis; it was possible to predict its occurrence basedon five variables."

In 2014 there was a rule from the National Directorate of Health addressed to this problem.This study aims to quantify the patients with indication to search for MRSA colonization, examine the criteria, implicationsand possible strategies.Materials and Methods: Prospective data about patients admitted to an Internal Medicine Department in five non-consecutiveweeks.Results: The sample includes 224 patients, mostly female, with a mean age of 76 years old. The majority (60.3%) presented indication for screening, which was conducted in 39.3% of the patients; 28.3% were positive. The most common criteria presented were prior antibiotic therapy (37.1%), recent hospitalization (32.1%) and transfer from a hospitalinstitution (16.1%).Discussion: The age factor seems to influence the probability of indication for screening. Most patients showed indication to search for MRSA colonization (60.3%), which means a huge need for practices change. The high level of antibiotic therapy assumes great relevance in this sample (37.1%). In most of the patients, the screening was not done and it is necessary to sensitize the medical and nursing team.Conclusion: It is important to require good practices from health professionals for the implementation of new rules and ensure operating conditions in the services in order they can be applied. It is crucial that the strategies are not implementedalone. The patient must fulfill his part by not taking unjustified antibiotics."

Analytical evaluation presentedan elevation of the inflammatory parameters, renal dysfunction and a slight elevation of serum amylase and lipase, aswell as severe hyperchloremic acidemia. The first diagnosis hypothesis was thought to be acute pancreatitis. However, attending to the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidemia with normal anion gap and due to bicarbonate loss, the hypothesisof acidemia after ileocystoplasty was more consistent. Treatment with endovenous and oral bicarbonate was institutedand clinical and analytical improvement were observed. It is essential to foresee the metabolic complications of this procedureand consider all possible diagnoses in order to diagnose and treat early, preventing associated morbidity."

                    "Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disordercharacterized by chronic hyperglycemia and by the developmentof serious complications which determine the loss of thepatient’s quality of life. The evaluation of the glycemic controlin diabetic patients can be made based on the glycatedhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value. However, several studiesreported that anemia may limit the determination of HbA1c.Therefore it is important to assess the relationship betweenthe HbA1c value, the hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) andthe mean corpuscular volume (MCV).Material and Methods: Retrospective study, performed in acentral hospital, based on the collection of HbA1c values andhematological parameters, such as [Hb] and MCV in all analysesperformed in the last 10 years (2005-2015).Results: The results showed that when MCV< 80 fL and [Hb]<12 g/dL (women) or [Hb]< 13 g/dL (men), the HbA1c value wassignificantly higher than the value determined when MCV>80fL and [Hb] ≥ 12 g/dL (women) or [Hb]≥13 g/dL (men).Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed that the [Hb]and the MCV may influence the value of HbA1c. In a diabeticpatient, an increased value of HbA1c may not be indicative ofpoor metabolic control but it could be associated with anemia.It is therefore, important to make the determination of HbA1cand correlate the value with the [Hb], the MCV and plasmaglucose."

More than one secondaryHTG risk factor was presented in 45.95% of patients. TPE group presented higher TG levels at admission: 4850± 2802 mg/dL vs 1845 ± 1858 mg/dL (p = 0.001). No significantstatistical differences were observed considering lengthof hospital stay [14.2 ± 6.8 days vs 13.5 ± 9.0 days (p = 0.56)]or mortality rate (p = 0.47). At discharge, TG reduction wasgreater in TPE group: 4433.70 ± 2896.08 mg/dL – 91.41% vs1582.95 ± 2051.06 mg/dL – 83,92% (p = 0.002). Six minorcomplications associated to TPE occurred.Discussion/Conclusion: Despite the selection bias (retrospectivestudy), a greater TG reduction was observed with TPEtechnique. Complications associated with the technique weresimple to resolve."

The most common overall pathogen is Streptococcuspneumoniae, however, influenza virus is also commonand is associated with severe disease. The viral etiology ofpneumonia is underdiagnosed. We analyzed and comparedthe clinical, laboratory and radiological data, severity at admissionand outcome of patients with influenza A pneumoniaand pneumococcal pneumonia.Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical and epidemiologicaldata of hospitalized patients between October 1, 2013 andMarch 31, 2014, in a medium-sized Hospital, with confirmedinfluenza A pneumonia and/or pneumococcal pneumonia.Results: We identified 40 cases of pneumococcal pneumoniaand 40 cases of influenza A pneumonia. In the viral pneumoniagroup the mean age was 65.8 years (vs 74.6 (p = 0.017)).Pneumococcal pneumonia patients had higher Charlson comorbiditiesindex (median 7 vs 4, p < 0.001), higher CURB-65(p = 0.001) and white blood cells count (15273 vs 9656 / μL, p< 0.001) and C-reactive protein at admission (191 vs 115 mg /L, p = 0.014) were higher. In viral cases there was more needto escalate level of medical care (43% vs 18%, p = 0.015), withno significant difference in in-hospital mortality.Conclusion: We obtained the same number of patients in eachgroup, which reveals a higher prevalence of influenza than wenormally expect. Compared to patients with pneumococcalpneumonia, patients with viral pneumonia were younger andhad a lower comorbidities index; on admission, they presentedlower inflammatory parameters and CURB-65; the need toescalate care was higher, however mortality was not significantlydifferent."

                    "The skin, as the largest organ of the human body, can havea key role in the early diagnosis of systemic diseases. Cutaneousmanifestations can be the initial symptom of certainmalignant hematological diseases (Hodgkin lymphoma,chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia).These can be classified as specific when caused by directinvasion of malignant cells in the skin or by loco-regional expansionof the tumoral disease or unspecific when causedby the altered regulation of the immune system typical ofoncologic patients (characterized by absence of neoplasticcells in the skin). The unspecific injuries are more frequent,have polymorphous appearance and may precede, followor have a parallel course with the underlying malignancy. Inthis article, the most frequent cutaneous diseases associatedwith hematological malignancies are reviewed, namelyneutrophilic dermatoses (Sweet syndrome and pyodermagangrenosum), connective tissue diseases (dermatomyositis),pruritus of unknown origin and vesiculobullous disorders(pemphigus vulgaris and paraneoplastic pemphigus).Although less common, other diseases are also associatedwith malignancy such as amyloidosis, reactive erythemas,vascular dermatoses (livedo reticularis, erythromelalgia andvasculitis) and other disorders (acanthosis nigricans, sign ofLeser-Trélat and acquired ichthyosis). The main purpose ofthis review is to highlight the relevance of cutaneous manifestationsthat can be the first symptom of hematological malignanciesand lead to differential diagnosis."

In 2007, for the first time since its discovery,Zika virus was responsible for infecting about threequarters of the population from a pacific island, where a benignand self-limited clinical course was verified. Six yearslater, an unprecedented epidemic occurred in French Polynesia,between 2013 and 2014. For the first time there weredescriptions of Guillain-Barré syndrome as a complicationassociated with the infection. Zika virus is estimated to havebeen introduced in Brazil at this time. By the end of 2015, a risingnumber of cases of microcephaly and other fetal malformationsreported in this country seem to be possibly relatedto the Zika epidemic, a fact with growing evidence.At the moment, autochthonous transmission is known tooccur in more than seventy countries by way of vectorialtransmission through Aedes mosquitos. Sexual transmissionhas been reported in several countries with importedcases. However, its real impact in the current pandemic isnot known, as it is difficult to determine the transmission incountries where vectorial transmission occurs.Current strategies in prevention of the infection and its disseminationinclude vector control and individual protectivemeasures."

Methods: A retrospective, observational study of descriptive character that focused on patients treated in the UCAD during its first year of operation (from September 2013 to September 2014). On each inpatient episode was collected information about demography; diagnosis and comorbidities of the trea-ted patients; intra-hospital transfers; reasons for internment; rates of utilization of advanced hemodynamic and ventilatory supports and mortality results, average time of internment and outpatients’ destination of the patients admitted in the Diffe-rentiated Acute Care Unit of Hospital Center of Cova da Beira during the period in study. Results: The patients treated in the Acute Differentiated Care Unit of Hospital Center of Cova da Beira belong to higher age groups with the average age being 73 years. The inpatient average time was only 2 days and the unit´s occupancy rate was around 88%. The main reasons for hospitalization were diseases of the respiratory tract, followed by cardiovascular disease. A substantial number of patients had, as secondary diagnoses, cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the endocri-ne glands, nutrition, metabolism and immune disorders and diseases of the respiratory system. Of the various performed procedures, stands out the use of intravenous antibiotics and oxygen therapy. Conclusions: The creation of this unit has reinforced the growing need to integrate the different levels of care within the hospital structure, allowing to fill some gaps of Hospital Center of Cova da Beira."

                    "Introduction: Despite an improvement in diagnostic and the- rapeutic procedures, infective endocarditis still carries a high mortality and morbidity that has been unchanged for the last 30 years. There has been a recent epidemiological shift trans- lated by an increase of prevalence in older patients, without the characteristic risk factors. This audit aims at analysing the characteristics of the patients admitted to the Internal Medi- cine wards due to infective endocarditis in a six year period. Methods: We selected all the cases coded as infective endo- carditis admitted to the Internal Medicine ward in the period from 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2014. Clinical data was obtained from the electronic medical records.",
                    "Results: We identified 40 cases (in 39 patients-32 men and seven women, medium age 62.3 years), which fulfilled the modified Duke’s criteria. Twenty-eight (70.0%) patients had native-valve endocarditis, five (12.5%) had prosthetic-valve involvement and two (5.0%) had vegetations elsewhere. Blood cultures were positive in 31 (77.5%) patients. Twenty-eight (70.0%) patients had complications, with valvular regurgitation in 15 (53.5%). Surgical intervention was required in 16 (40.0%) patients. Medium-time to diagnosis was 8.1 days. The avera- ge duration of in-hospital stay was 24.37 ± 31.68 days, with an in-hospital mortality of 17.5% (seven patients).",
                    "Conclusion: Our analysis reflects the reported epidemiologic shift with an increased incidence in older patients with a more severe presentation at admission. There was an increased in- cidence in an older population, which had more co-morbidi- ties and a more serious clinical presentation."

                    "Fahr ́s disease is characterized by deposits of calcium in the brain. It manifests itself at any age, most often in the 4th de- cade of life. The clinical presentation is variable and can be presented from the asymptomatic form, to the combination of various neurological symptoms, including impaired cognitive function (dementia), motor or language changes, seizures, headache, muscular stiffness, among others. The diagnosis is usually clinical, associated with hypocalcemia and calcifi- cation of the basal ganglia in imaging tests. It is an incurable disease, with reserved and fatal prognosis. We describe a case of a 68-year-old male patient, with complaints of gene- ralized muscle rigidity, perioral fasciculations and slowness of writing movements that started a clinical study after the beginning of fainting episodes preceded by chills, nausea and headache. Analytically the presence of hypocalcaemia of 6.2 mg/dL and computed tomography scan showed multi- ple calcifications involving the basal ganglia."

The objective of this study was to pre- sent a current literature review and analysis to the approach to patient care in the last hours or days of life. Patient symp- toms and signs during this period include exacerbations of the existing symptoms and the onset of new ailments, such as: the decline of the level of consciousness; deterioration of the physical state; the reduction of food and fluid intake; the increase in oropharyngeal secretions; changes in elimi- nation; instances of peripheral edema; changes in body tem- perature; peripheral perfusion alteration; signs of respiratory distress; and understanding, verbalized or not, of the reality of their impending death.

This method is currently considered safe and hasa growing applicability in ambulatory regime. The objectiveswere to study the safety profile of BHP performed in our hospital,evaluate the specialty of the executor, the main indicationsfor the procedure, the usefulness of the results and its applicabilityas an outpatient procedure.Material and Methods: We reviewed retrospectively all patientsundergoing BHP in our hospital over a period of 9 years.Exclusion criteria: post-mortem liver biopsies. We studied demographic,clinical and pathological data.Results: We included 137 procedures performed in 133 consecutivepatients (age 51.3 ± 17.2 years, 57.1% were male). Themain indication for BHP was the evaluation of hepatic masses,followed by staging and therapeutic decision at hepatitis C infectionand evaluation of elevated transaminases. The primarypurpose of the procedure was the diagnosis. Gastroenterologywas the medical specialty responsible for most procedures(51.8%). The pathologic results were conclusive in 86.1%of biopsies. The rate of complications described was 0.73%(n = 1): it was one pneumothorax and death in a patient of theintensive care unit. In our population, 12.4% of patients weredischarged at the same day. There were no complicationsdescribed in this subgroup.Conclusion: In this study, BHP was a safe technique, with alow rate of serious complications which affirms its applicationin ambulatory regime. Its result was inconclusive in 14%, indicatingthe possibility of optimization in the future."

                    "Introduction: Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist availablein Portugal since January 2014. The authors intend to evaluatethe clinical benefit of this new drug in a population of diabeticpatients of high complexity, followed in a hospital consultation.Material and Methods: Descriptive study including patientswith type 2 diabetes followed in Diabetes outpatient clinic of atertiary hospital treated with liraglutide. Analyzed data includedweight, waist circumference, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine,estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria/creatinineratio. Results: We included 20 patients, age 62.5 years [54.75-68], diabetes for 15 years [10-21.5] polymedicated with difficultglycemic control and good renal function. There was improvementin glycemic control after 3 months of treatment, but thiswas not maintained over time in most patients (median decreaseof, in absolute value, 0.25% in glycated hemoglobin). Therewas a decrease of 2.25 kg in 12 months. The patients showedslight increase of creatinine and decreased glomerular filtrationrate after 12 months, with no statistical significance. The drugproved to be safe and well tolerated.Discussion: There is great variability in the response to thisnew therapeutic tool both in terms of glycemic control andweight, with some patients showing significant benefit, eventhough not statistically significant globally.Conclusion: Liraglutide is a well-tolerated drug and useful inselected patients. In the overall population studied we did notfind significant clinical benefit, but a subgroup of patients obtainedimprovement in glycemic and/or weight control."

Around 2-12% of thepatients classified with diabetes mellitus type 2 have LADA.The diagnosis is based on the 2006 Fourlanos criteria: age ofonset < 50 years, acute symptoms, BMI < 25 kg/m2, personalor family history of autoimmune disease. The presence of atleast two of these clinical features justifies testing for GAD antibodies(GADA). In these patients, anti-insulin antibodies (IAA)are rare while GADA are usually present although they maydisappear over time.Materials and methods: A retrospective study of the medicalrecords, collected in the period between January 1st, 2013and December 31st, 2015, in the Diabetes Unit was performed.Results: Fifteen patients with positive antibodies to LADA wereidentified. Eight were male and seven were female. The meanage at diagnosis was 43 years. The average body mass indexwas 23.8 kg/m2. All patients had titles of GADA> 1U/mL (maximum84, 34 U/L). 87% started treatment with insulin after thediagnosis. The average time between diagnosis and insulintreatment was 2 years. In 11 of these patients other autoimmunediseases were diagnosed, the most frequent one wasthyroiditis (seven of 15 patients).Conclusion: LADA occurs in adults with type 2 diabetes phenotype.The diagnosis is vital so that insulin therapy can bestarted early and other autoimmune diseases associated withLADA can be diagnosed."

We aim to evaluate theperception of anaemia diagnosis in the Portuguese population,as well as evaluate the characteristics and predictorsof anaemia.Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional, epidemiologicalstudy comprising a sample of 7890 adults representativeof the Portuguese population. Participants were inquiredabout their demographic, anthropometric and clinicalcharacteristics, and their perception about the diagnosisof anaemia; serum levels of haemoglobin, ferritin, creatinineand C-reactive protein were measured using point-ofcaredevices. Anaemia was classified according to thecriteria of the World Health Organization.Results: Although the prevalence on anaemia in Portugalis estimated at 20.6%, only 10.2% of participants referredhaving had a diagnosis of anaemia. The perceptionof anaemia was higher within the region of Lisbon andTagus Valley (20.6%). Nutritional deficiency anaemia(57.7%), especially iron deficiency anaemia (52.7%), representedmost known diagnosed cases. Only 52.6% ofparticipants that have had the diagnosis of anaemia reportedbeing treated; among those, iron supplementationwas the most common treatment. At the time of the studyonly 0.8% of participants with “measured” anaemia wason specific treatment. The following predictors of anaemiawere identified: female gender, age ≥ 80 years, vegetariandiet, student as professional situation, treatment withanticoagulants and gastric protectors, renal failure, andiron deficiency.Discussion and Conclusions: Although anaemia affectsapproximately one in five Portuguese residents, the perceptionof the disease is alarmingly low, suggesting ahigh rate of undiagnosed/untreated cases. Strategies toimprove awareness of this condition should be urgently developed, especially in high-risk groups."

The entire system is subject to thepolicy of the managers who must have a proactive and notreactive role, accepting their insecurities towards this, difficultto control, hospital entryway.Any intervention in this field must always take into accountthe physical deployment of emergency services,their accessibility, responsiveness in critical situations andworking conditions, pillars that will determine the level ofcare provided there and consequent demand.In this chaotic environment, good leadership is essential,in which the leader is not only an example of character,respect and justice, but also a manager and a communicator,which creates conditions for an adaptive and expansivelearning, which can contribute to improving care."

Its reported prevalence variesaccording to clinical differentiation, admission criteria andresource to complementary means of diagnosis. The authorspretend to characterize stroke mimic admitted to a stroke unit,integrated in an internal medicine department of a universityhospital.Material and Methods: An observational, descriptive and retrospectivestudy of patients over a 26-month period. Stroke mimicswere considered whenever clinical and/or radiological data supporteda non-vascular cause of the neurological deficit.Results: From a cohort of 367 patients, with a median age of76 years old, 12% were classified as stroke mimics. The maindiagnoses were: somatoform disorder, peripheral vertigo, metabolicdiseases, syncope, Munchausen syndrome, intracranialtumors, epilepsy and Chiari malformations. Mimics weregenerally younger, more often women, had a lower neurologicdeficit on admission, as well as lower rates of previous knownatrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.05). Vascularrisk factors were not a criterion of distinction betweenmimics and stroke.Conclusion: Contrary to what we might expect, there is asubstantial prevalence of stroke mimics within a stroke unit(12%). The nature of these mimics, some of which requireurgent intervention, can be used to better inform emergencyclinicians and plan for alternative interventional pathways."

It consist in 4 items on basic daily livingactivities, 5 on instrumental activities and 11 on social andfunctional profile - maximum score is 20. This prospective studyincluded all patients with 65 years or older admitted in IMDbetween September 2013 and October 2014, and aimed tocross data on functional assessment with length of stay, in hospitaland after discharge mortality and readmissions. Statisticalanalysis was made with SPSS 20.0.Results: Aging contributes to increase the score AVD-DezIs(10.8-5.45), but not for the length of stay (9.8-12.2), in patientsover 85 years old and under 75 years, respectively. There wereno significant differences with regard to in-hospital mortality(82.3-79.9) and 30 days after discharge (80.9-80.2), readmissionsin Emergency (80.3-80.2) and in IMD (80.3-79.6). Therewere no significant differences between the AVD-DezIs scoreand length of stay. In contrast, AVD-DezIs score was higher inpatient who died during hospitalization (11.5-8.4) and in thosewho died until 30 days after discharge (12.2-8.4). Patients readmittedin IMD and Emergency had higher AVD-DezIs score thanpatients without readmission (9.7-8.1 e 10.2-8.4, respectively).Conclusion: Aging has no relation with higher length of stay,mortality and readmission. Instead, AVD-DezIs functional assessmentis a good tool to predict these outcomes."

This is facilitated by the easy acquisition of toxic substances.Objectives: Characterization of the acute poisoning hospitalizationsin the IMS and its evolution.Material and methods: Descriptive and inferential retrospectiveanalysis of the patients hospitalized from January 2002 to December2014, in the ICD of the Hospitais da Universidade deCoimbra, considering: age, sex, length of hospital admission,intentionality, duration of the mechanical ventilation, mortalityand previous poisoning history or psychiatric illness. The datawas obtained from the ICD data base. Statistical analysis wasperformed with SPSS version 20.0® program. Results: The 234identified patients were aged between 13 and 83 years (mean50.79 years ± 16.99) and 55.98% were male. In 88.90% of thecases, the poisoning was voluntary, with no statistically significantdifference between genders. There was a statisticallysignificant relationship between the female gender and thehistory of poisoning, p = 0.014. The toxic agent was veryheterogeneous, but drugs were the most frequent source ofintoxication (35.04%) and 19.66% of patients used more thanone toxic agent. The length of hospital stay, duration of mechanicalventilation and the APACHE II score showed statisticallysignificant differences when poisoning by pesticides,drugs or alcohol (p < 0.001) were compared.Discussion: The results are consistent with previous datafrom other authors, revealing the gradual reduction of pesticidepoisonings. Overall, mortality was lower than the averageof admissions in the ICD by other causes. When comparedwith other toxics, poisoning by pesticides had the worstprognosis.Conclusion: Accumulated experience in treating these patientsallowed therapeutic optimization and improved the prognosis.Nevertheless, it is still not possible to identify a psychologicalprofile of the patient with increased risk of death from poisoning"

It is a commonand serious problem amongst palliative care hospitalizedpatients. Our aim was to perform a systematic reviewon the recent scientific evidence (between April 2011 andAugust 2015) concerning the treatment of delirium in thispopulation. From the 2539 articles, we include nine. Two ofthem were about non-pharmacological strategies in frail oldpatients. We found only one comparative study that showssimilarity in the efficacy of haloperidol and aripiprazole, althoughmore adverse effects were found in the first one. Aripiprazoleappears to be less effective in hyperactive deliriumtreatment. Melatonin analogues are between the new drugsunder investigation. Guidelines mostly derive from experts orfrom studies that exclude palliative care patients. Prospectivecomparative studies, with a placebo arm, longer follow--up, double blinded and randomized are needed. Concerningpatients with palliative needs that develop delirium it isurgent to evaluate the potential reversibility of the episode,ensuring support to caregivers and adopting pharmacologicalor non-pharmacological measures that benefit the qualityof life and the goals of both patient and family."

Consequently, primary geriatriccare must include the assessment of functional status,iterated review of medication and thoughtful considerationof the potential benefits and adverse effects of treatment, inorder to achieve the proposed objectives. Oral anticoagulationis often disapproved and less used. Shared decision--making is necessary.

                    "Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of chronic kidneydisease, which is often undervalued. The aim of this study was todetermine the prevalence of chronic kidney disease among diabeticpatients type 2, even showing normal serum creatinine.Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study with aprocess of clinical revision and analytical results was conducted,involving a total of 483 patients who were followed by external medicineconsultation in what concerns diabetes during the year of 2014.Results: Of the total of patients 60% were women, which mean agewas 65 ± 10.6 years. The studied participants revealed that 31.7%,according to MDRD4 equation and 28.0%, according to Crockcoft-Gault equation, suffered from chronic kidney disease (defined asglomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The distributionamong the different stages was the following by MDRD4 equation:13.9% in stage, 9.1% in stage 3b, 6.8% in stage 4 and 1.9%in stage 5. In what concerns the Crockcoft-Gault equation, we had:11.6%, 7.9%, 4.1% and 1.7% respectively. Only 44.4% and 43.7%of those with GFR < 60 mL/min /1.73 m2, according to the equationsMDRD4 and GCC presented serum creatinine higher than 1.5mg/dL, despite only in 58.0% the chronic kidney disease was recognized.Microalbuminuria was found in 113 patients (23.4%) of which 48(MDRD4) and 40 (CCG) showed GFR < 60 mL/min /1.73 m2.Conclusion: This study revealed that chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosedand that microalbuminuria appears precociously, despitenormal serum creatinine and GFR can be still unchanged. Assessmentof renal function is therefore important, since detecting chronic kidneydisease during its initial stages provides the opportunity for early therapeuticinterventions."

The cardiovascular risk factors were defined by validatedcriteria. Independent samples t-student and Mann-Whitneytests were used to compare rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls.Related samples t-student and Wilcoxon tests were carried outto compare patients in different disease stages. Furthermore, logisticregression was also performed to determine the main predictors ofpatients’ cardiovascular risk.Results: From 109 patients and 218 healthy subjects (70.6% female;average age: 53 years), HDL, LDL, triglycerides and Framinghamscale at patients’ diagnosis were significantly different from controls(p < 0.01). Currently, diastolic blood pressure and glomerular filtrationrate from patients were different from controls (p < 0.05). Patients hadhigher diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL at diagnosisthan recently (p < 0.05) and lower HDL (p < 0.001). Finally, age, systolicblood pressure, LDL and triglycerides were associated with a highercardiovascular risk (p < 0.05) while female gender, diastolic blood pressureand total cholesterol were associated with lower cardiovascularrisk (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Rheumatoid arthritis patients have a high-risk lipid profileand high blood pressure at diagnosis, which provides an elevated cardiovascularrisk."

Important features ofdifferentiated care for the stroke patients include a stroke unit,an approach by a multidisciplinary team and a comprehensiveorganization. Window-dependent diagnosis and therapies, suchas intravenous thrombolytic therapy, access to thrombectomy,early mobilization and rehabilitation are also required. The mainobjective was the quality assessment to the different stages ofthe “stroke circuit” of CHTV, over a period of two years after theimplementation of some measures which intended to improveevent-door and door-to-needle times.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical andALERT® records of patients admitted to the Stroke unit of CHTVthat underwent intravenous thrombolysis. We analyzed the demographics,the various steps that compose the stroke circuit, timeof hospitalization and NIHS score on admission and after intravenoustreatment.Results: In the period proposed, 92 patients undergone thrombolysis,but only 81 patients met the inclusion criteria. The averageage of patients was 71.93 years, with a predominance offemales. Overall, the times symptom-door and symptom-needlehad a normal distribution while maintaining the medium similarprecedent averages. They were not influenced by other times thatcomprise them.Conclusion: A well-structured “stroke circuit” and its implementationit’s essential to improve the functional outcome. There aremany logistical barriers that limit their performance, but to understandwhere you can “save time” is crucial."

                    "Background: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a conditionthat affects immunocompromised individuals. It is the most commonopportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectedindividuals. Despite a decline in its incidence, severe PJP continues tobe a common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.Material and Methods: Retrospective study (2000-2013) of patientswith PJP admitted to an ICU at a university hospital. Data regardingrisk factors, diagnosis, treatment, length of stay and mortality wasanalyzed.Results: A total of 27 patients with a mean age of 47.7 (+13.4) yearswere identified, from which 81.7% were male. Identified risks factorswere HIV infection (44.4%), transplant (18.5%), neoplasms (7.4%), vasculitisand hepatitis C (3.7%). No risk factor was identified for 22.2%. In83.3% of the HIV patients, this diagnosis was unknown and none wason prophylaxis. All HIV patients had CD4+ < 200 cells/microL. PJ wasmainly (96.3%) identified on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Invasivemechanical ventilation and vasopressors were necessary for 6.3% and62.9% of the patients, respectively. Three HIV positive patients stayedon ART during treatment. Seven patients (25.9%) developed pneumothorax.The mean length of hospital stay was 17.4 days. Mortalityreached 51.9%.Conclusion: PJP affected mainly young male individuals with HIVinfection and CD4+ < 200 cells/μL. A significant number of patientshad no identifiable risk factor for PJP. In most cases, the diagnosiswas carried out in BAL. The co-trimoxazole was the first therapeuticoption in all cases. The number of individuals under ART was low. Bothseverity and mortality of the patients were high."

AL amyloidosis:53.3% were women and the mean age was 68.5 years. The diagnosiswas made primarily by renal biopsy (46.7%). Half (53.3%)had multiple myeloma, 20% monoclonal gammopathy, 20% isolatedAL amyloidosis and 6.7% non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma. Themajor manifestations were renal (66.7%), cardiac (46.7%) andgastrointestinal (26.7%). Most had renal insufficiency (86.7%)and proteinuria (93.3%). More than half (66.7%) died. AA amyloidosis:the majority were female (63.6%) and the mean age 59.1years. The diagnosis was performed by renal biopsy in 63.6%.About half (45.5%) had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and idiopathic AAamyloidosis was diagnosed in 27.3%. The main manifestationswere renal (90.9%), cardiac (27.3%) and gastrointestinal (27.3%).All patients had proteinuria and 81.8% had kidney failure. Fourpatients (36.4%) started dialysis and 54.5% died.Conclusion: Amyloidosis is a rare disease that affects middle-aged individuals of both genders. It can be diagnosed bybiopsy of affected organs. It produces various systemic disorders,with special emphasis on proteinuria and kidney failure, leading toend-stage renal disease and death in a significant percentage ofpatients."

Thequestionnaire consisted of fifteen clinical cases typified.Results: A total 98.5% of respondents respected the right to revelationof truth. Complied with the principle of beneficence 79.4% of respondentsand 30.9% agreed not to reveal the truth if it implied a psychologicalthreat to the patient respecting the principle of non-maleficence.When two patients required mechanical ventilation, 66.2% of surveyeddoctors agreed with the non-discrimination by age, respecting theprinciple of justice.Discussion: Most doctors respected the dignity, autonomy and theneed to be warned of the risks by informed consent. Most consideredthe patient's welfare, acting in the sense of the greater good. It is thedoctor’s duty to search for effectiveness and efficiency in strict managementof resources while respecting the principle of justice, withoutforgetting that aggressive medical treatment may be inhumane andundermine the dignity, violating the principle of non-maleficence.Conclusion: Most doctors complied with the principles of dignity,autonomy and beneficence. The non-maleficence and justice issuesgenerated controversy, since they are in conflict with the principles ofautonomy and beneficence. Doctors must take their decisions in fullfreedom, respecting the autonomy of the human being and providingbenefit to health. It is also their duty not to cause intentional harm ordamage to the patients, acting responsively with the resources at theirdisposal in order to provide health."

Optimize O2 delivery (DO2) to prevent andsupport organ dysfunction; 3. Focus control with proper antibiotics andsurgery/drainage (when indicated). After 2012 SSC recommendationsseveral papers have been published changing state of the art for clinicalpractice.The initial manifestations depend on the immune status andthe presence of comorbidities. The number of SIRS criteria clinicallyrecognized correlates with prognosis and demand the research forseverity criteria that, when installed, establish urgent intervention procedure.Disoxia manifestations (hyperlactatemia) of hypotension thatdo not respond to proper volume infusion and/or are associated toorgan dysfunction, once again, are the most serious. Fluid’s prescriptionin sepsis should not include starches, gelatins or hyperosmoticfluids. It has been recognized that albumin has no deleterious effectson sepsis but is not recommended for hemodynamic stabilization.Balanced crystalloid are preferred as fluids for resuscitation becauseof the risk hyperchloremicacidosis with 0.9% saline. Presently no fluidis recommended as the ideal one. Ultrasounds, along with the patientitself, have an important role in the differential diagnosis and severitystratification, evaluating treatment response and identifying the causeof sepsis. Severity stratification and treatment monitoring should followthe “2O+2C” strategy, resumed in 4 questions: How is oxygenation?How is circulation? How are organs? How is the cell?

                    "Background: Malaria represents the most significant of parasitic diseases in humans. The last endemic cases reported in Portugal date back to 1959 and since then all cases have been imported. Objective: characterize the malaria cases diagnosed in a Portuguese hospital from 2002 to 2013. Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients positive for Plasmodium. Results: The study sample included 51 patients, 44 of which were male, and with a mean age of 38 years old. The majority of the patients were of Portuguese nationality and the most common origin of transmission was Africa, followed by Timor and Brazil. Most of the patients were Portuguese professionals working abroad with previous history of malaria that were not on chemoprophylaxis. The most common symptom was fever followed by headache and myalgia, associated with raised inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction. Plasmodium falciparum was the most common diagnosed species and 15 patients filled the criteria for severe malaria. Most cases required hospital admission and the most frequent treatment consisted of quinine and doxycycline. Throughout the 12 years there was only 1 case of death which represents an overall mortality rate of 2%. Conclusion: New trends in emigration destinations and longterm travelers to endemic countries will certainly increase the number of malaria cases. It is therefore vital direct to our efforts into the improvement of diagnostic methods, treatment and pre-travel advice."

Recommendations on the management of acute stroke consider TEE as an essential exam in same patients, emphasizing the increasing use of TEE in a wider spectrum of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single-center experience of the safety of TEE in a special population of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: We included 171 adult patients (mean age 62.8 years) who underwent TEE because of the management of acute ischemic stroke. We determined complications of TEE: examination impossible to perform, pulmonary, cardiac and bleeding complications, trauma/ perforation and others (odynophagia, dental injury and death). Results: Of the 171 patients, 2.9% had minor complications: 2 cases of patient refusal, 2 cases of failure to successfully insert the TEE probe and 1 case of odynophagia. Major procedural complications were noted in one case (0.6%): an esophageal perforation.Discussion and Conclusion: In our study, TEE had one major complication, an esophageal perforation, but no deaths occurred. TEE is a safe procedure, even in acute stroke patients."

                    "Introduction: Low seric levels of total cholesterol (TC) and HDLcholesterol (HDL-c) are markers of poor outcome in several diseases.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 112 patients admitted in an Intensive Care Unit during a six month period. We considered 40 mg/dL and 46 mg/dL as critical HDL-c values for male and female patients. Patients were later divided into 2 groups: group A (HDL-c ≥ 40/46 mg/dL) and group B (HDL-c < 40/46 mg/dL). The association between HDL-c levels and the incidence of severe sepsis/septic shock and mortality was tested. Results: TC levels were higher in group A (p = 0.016), LDL-c levels did not differ (p = 0.537) and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in group B (p <0,001). Severe sepsis/septic shock was more prevalent in group B (p = 0.003). There was a considerable difference in intra-hospitalary mortality between groups (5.6% in group A vs. 21.1% no group B), very close to statistical significance (p = 0,052). Discussion: During the acute phase response triggered in sepsis occurs a drastic modification in lipid profile. In severe sepsis, the HDL particle undergoes several modifications, becoming the so called acute-phase HDL. In severe forms of sepsis/septic shock, negative acute phase proteins can be used as independent predictors of survival. Conclusion: HDL hypocholesterolemia is a marker of poor outcome in critically ill patients and is associated with a higher incidence of severe sepsis/septic shock and increased mortality"

                    "Introduction: Intermediate Medical Care Units (IMCU) are real needs of modern hospitals. They improve quality of care and reduce costs and, at the same time, make way for coordination between all hospital departments. We present a study of an IMCU, since its opening in 2005 until 2014, in order to ascertain what’s the reality when in charge of Internal Medicine.Material and Methods: The authors performed a retrospective and descriptive analysis of the patients admitted in the above IMCU between October the 29th 2005 and December the 31st 2014. Results: In the IMCU 1641 patients were admitted, 46% female and 54% male, with an average age of 61 years. The average hospital stay was about 4 days. Most of the patients came from the emergency department (45.3%), followed by the ward of Internal Medicine (27.1%) and the Intensive Care Unit (20.9%). The main reasons for admission were pneumonia (33.5%), which came up with great expression, intoxication (8.7%), pulmonary embolism (8.3%) and global respiratory failure (7.1%). The mortality rate was 5.7%. Step-up occurred in 7.9% of patients and step-down in 92.1%, with the vast majority of patients being transferred to the ward of Internal Medicine. In the 2 years since its institution in the IMCU, non-invasive ventilation was performed in 23.0% of patients enrolled and mainly used in the context of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (39.9% of cases), pneumonia (30.3%) and acute pulmonary edema (20.8%). Conclusion: This unit reinforces the importance of IMCUs as a bridge between the different departments and as form of intervention in a plurality of ways, resulting in a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency in improving care and maximizing resources, with a low mortality rate."

The sudden onset of symptoms such as confusion, cognitive impairment, irritability, depression, hallucinations, is one of the main characteristics. It is an inflammatory disease involving the temporal lobes, which explains the frequency of seizures. We report the case of a 27-year-old man, presenting hyperosmolar syndrome (owing to new onset diabetes mellitus), acute confusional state and sudden onset of seizures. Several diagnostic hypotheses were raised: infectious meningoencephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis, and metabolic encephalopathy. Despite treatment (antibiotics, correction of hyperosmolar state and anticonvulsant therapy), continuous cognitive deterioration and seizures persisted. We raised the hypothesis of an autoimmune limbic encephalitis by anti-GAD antibodies and treated with human immunoglobulin. There was a dramatic improvement, corroborating the diagnosis (along with imaging findings). Although difficult to diagnose, limbic encephalitis should be considered when studying acute confusional states with psychiatric symptoms and seizures. Clinical suspicion and early treatment are essential for therapeutic success."

                    "Results: We collected 213 valid questionnaires (estimated response rate of 28.4%). Average global satisfaction with the internship was 4.05/6 (±1.14). The most unsatisfied residents were those with more weekly working hours (p =0.018) hours in the emergency department (p = 0.010), worst working environment among residents (p <0.001) and higher frequency of taking decisions they felt unprepared to (p <0.001). A statistical model identified as satisfaction predicting factors (p <0.001): satisfaction with training in the ward, in the emergency department and in the outpatient setting as well as satisfaction with their mentor; accounting for 69.0% of the satisfaction with the internship (R2=0.69; R2a=0.68). Discussion: The quality of the training in the emergency department, as well as the long hours and the difficult decision making, contribute to lower satisfaction rates. The prediction model identified as key aspects of residency satisfaction, the quality in the emergency and outpatient settings, as well the satisfaction with the mentor. Conclusion: Portuguese Internal Medicine residents are overall satisfied with their training. Training in the ward, emergency and outpatient settings are key aspects to consider in order to improving internship."

                    "Introduction: The rising frequency of extended spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae in recent years represents an important public health issue, with scarce effective alternatives for treatment. Several international studies have demonstrated very high in vitro susceptibility of these bacteria to fosfomycin. The clinical efficiency of this treatment was tested on acute uncomplicated cystitis due to Escherichia coli subset, with encouraging results. In Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca EPE (HFF) there has been a progressive annual increase in the isolation of these pathogens. The authors’ goal was to test the susceptibility of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to fosfomycin in HFF and assess its possible therapeutic potential. Material and methods: Prospective study (6 month period), in which the susceptibility to fosfomycin of isolated ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was tested. The VITEK 2® equipment was used to identify the strains. The fosfomycin susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method (Oxoid®). Statistical analysis was performed using the Microsoft Excel® software. Results: We identified 150 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, of which 52 % corresponded to Klebsiella pneumoniae and 44% to Escherichia coli. Approximately 88% of Escherichia coli and 68% of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to fosfomycin. Conclusions: Based on the data obtained at international level and in this study, the authors recommend the use of fosfomycin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. Future clinical efficacy research is needed in order to substantiate this practice and recommendation."

                    "Introduction: In order to know the adequacy and effectiveness of the prehospital emergency teams a descriptive study was conducted in Cova da Beira. Material and Methods: We compared the final diagnosis made by the physician in the prehospital emergency team with the final diagnosis made at the hospital. Severity/complexity of the conditions that led to activation of prehospital emergency teams was assessed using the patient’s final destination at the hospital. Results: We found that in all groups of the International Classification of Diseases there was an overdiagnosis made by the prehospital emergency staff, in which the asthma diagnosis was the one that presented the biggest difference when compared to the hospital diagnosis. In the case of prehospital diagnosis of stroke we found that 30.8% (12/39) of these cases were not in fact primary neurologic disorders but oxygenation and/or hemodynamic problems with neurologic symptoms. In the circulatory system, 51.7% (15/29) of the diagnostic hypotheses posed as unstable angina were not related with the coronary fast-track. The most frequent result of Emergency Department stays was hospital discharge, in all systems except in the respiratory. Therefore, the majority activations correspond to a mild degree of severity/complexity. Death and hospitalization occurred most frequently in cases related to problems/ diagnosis of the respiratory system. Conclusion: There is an excessive tendency to establish specific nosologic diagnosis. Prehospital diagnostic hypothesis should be less nosological and more problem oriented. Problems of nervous system, circulatory and injuries / poisonings are the most prevalent in this region's prehospital activity, but respiratory problems are the system with poorest diagnostic performance and dimmest prognosis. Therefore, respiratory problems arise as a priority issue in VMER attention and preparation."

                    "Introduction: Recurrent pleural effusion is a frequent complication of oncologic diseases that greatly affects the patients’ quality of life. Pleurodesis is an option to treat these effusions, in order to alleviate symptoms and to improve the quality of life. This technique can also be used to treat benign pathologies. Objectives and Methods: retrospective descriptive study of patients that underwent a pleurodesis between the years 2009 and 2013, in an Internal Medicine Service, considering the indication for the procedure, technique, complications, success and follow-up, seeking to compare the results with the available literature. Results: 27 patients underwent pleurodesis during this period of time, mostly from the male sex. The average age was 67.3 years and the main subjacent disease was lung adenocarcinoma. Recurrent malignant pleural effusion was the main indication, and the other pleurodesis were motivated by pneumothorax. A chest tube was placed and talc was used in most cases. The technique was successful in 70.4% of the patients. The most frequent complications were pain and fever. 48.1% of the patients were submitted to some kind of treatment for their disease after the pleurodesis. 30-day mortality after the pleurodesis was 14.8% and 33% of patients were alive 6 months after the technique. Conclusion: All the pleurodesis were performed according to the established criteria. The success rates, complications and survival were consistent with the expected values. This success rate leads to less hospitalizations and admissions in the Emergency Department and to the improvement of the patients’ quality of life."

Simulation is currently the gold standard in health training, and has been given an increasing emphasis in the literature.Objectives and Methods: Taking this into account, the authors describe the design and implementation of the “Centro de Simulação Clínica da Madeira”, inaugurated in September 2012, with 74 courses conducted since its opening such courses are transversal to the various specialties and focused on training in critical and complex environments.Results: The Internal Medicine Service organized, coordinated by the author of this article, Maria da Luz Brazão, organized since 2014, nine Internal Medicine Clinical Simulation courses, directed at a total of 58 health professionals. Each course addresses clinical cases in emergency contexts, explored in scenarios with high-fidelity simulators and using debriefing strategies as a way of improvement through reflective practice, under the guidance of the trainer.Conclusion: Analyzing the Clinical Simulation courses in Internal Medicine, the authors found a high level of satisfaction among the trainees, both about the course itself and its practical implication, about 90% considering it “very good” in terms of personal development. Most trainees (75.9%) found the duration of the course “appropriate” and showed a high level of satisfaction about both the structures/support material and the performance of trainers."

She had a personal history of bilateral lens luxation. Under the suspicion of myopericarditis, an urgent transthoracic echocardiogram was requested which revealed acute type A aortic dissection and severe aortic regurgitation. She was immediately transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery department of a Central Hospital and underwent a Bentall procedure. MS has a systemic involvement, often affecting the aorta and heart valves, osteoarticular, ocular and respiratory tract. The wide phenotypic variability often impairs early recognition."

Granulomas are a rare finding on bone marrow biopsies and can have numerous etiologies, namely infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, drug related or sarcoidosis. In the absence of pathognomonic features, the combination of clinical, laboratorial, image and histological data is essential to establish a diagnosis. We report a case of a 59 year-old Caucasian, referred to Internal Medicine consultation for gout, an medicated with allopurinol and colchicine. Through his follow-up anemia and thrombocytopenia emerged. Myelogram and bone marrow biopsy revealed “numerous epithelioid granulomas, without multinucleated giant cells, without the identification of microorganisms on PAS diastase stain or Ziehl-Neelsen, without neoplastic cells, consistent with a granulomatous myelitis.” The proposed etiology was a drug hypersensitivity reaction to allopurinol so it was discontinued. The exam was repeated a year later and no granulomas were observed, which confirmed the diagnosis."

This study aims to determine readmission rates of General Internal Medicine patients and identify risk factors for readmission. Material and Methods: we conducted a retrospective observational study in which all General Internal Medicine patients admitted on the previous three months were considered. We determined the 30 day-readmission rate and its association with age, gender, primary diagnosis, comorbidities, length of stay and social support. Results: Were included 537 patients and 47 patients (8.8%) were readmitted within 30 days. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with readmission included male gender (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.08-3.85, p 0.03), presence of diabetes mellitus as comorbidity (OR 2.37; CI 1.27-4.43, p 0.07) and the presence of chronic kidney disease as comorbidity (OR 4.08, 95% CI 2.07-8.14, p <0.001). Conclusion: The 30 day-readmission rate of our General Internal Medicine patients is 8.8%. Male gender, the presence of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease as comorbidities were risk factors for readmission."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a step-by-step approach on the etiologic diagnosis. Methods: Analysis of hospital admissions studying the etiology of moderate to large pericardial effusions using a step-by-step approach that included general evaluation (clinical history and physical examination), basic diagnostic tests and pericardiocentesis. Results: The study included 44 patients, 81.8% with large pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis for diagnostic purposes was performed in 43.2% cases. The application of the algorithm led to the definition of an etiology in 70.5% patients. The most common causes were: neoplasm (18.2%), tuberculosis (15.9%), mechanical complication of myocardial infarction (13.6%), post-cardiac surgery (9.1%), collagen vascular disease (4.5%) and heart failure (4.5%). Phase I (clinical evaluation) of the protocol revealed 50.0% of the diagnosis, phase II (diagnostic tests) 15.9% and phase III (pericardiocentesis) 11.4%. On the follow-up, mean of 15.7 months, there was recurrence of pericardial effusion in 15.2% patients and the mortality rate was 36.4%, without any alteration to the initial diagnosis. The prognosis was dependent on the etiology. Conclusions: The use of a step-by-step approach revealed that the clinical history is the main tool to reach an etiologic diagnosis of a moderate to large pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis, which was diagnostic in 36.9% of the patients, is more accurate in the definition of the etiology."

Objective: To evaluate the correlation between albuminemia at admission and in hospital morbidity and mortality. Material and Methods: We evaluated 200 consecutive admissions to our Internal Medicine ward. According to their albuminemia at admission the patients were grouped (group 1:<2.8 g/dL; group 2: 2.8 – 3.5 g/dL; group 3: >3.5 g/dL). We also determined the age, dependence in daily activities, length of stay and mortality. SPSS® - V19.0 was the statistical program used to make the statistical work of the data collected. Results: We found that 46% of the patients (92) were in group 1. Older and more dependent patients had lower albuminemia values (p<0.001). The ANOVA test showed that patients with lower albuminemia had longer length of stay (p=0.02). The Qui-square test for a linear trend identified a significant correlation between albuminemia and mortality (p=0.001). Discussion: The results described, being statistically significant, may not imply that albuminemia is directly responsible. It may be a marker of other risk factors. Conclusion: Our results show that hypoalbuminemia at admission correlates with longer length of stay and higher mortality"

                    "Introduction: The prevention of stress ulcers (SU) is well established in intensive care units, however, recently, this practice has been extended to medical wards, despite little evidence to support it. Its implementation is based on the association of various risk factors, however, studies show that 56 to 71% of patients under SU prophylaxis in medical wards have no such criteria. Objective: With this reality in mind, a trial was developed with the intent to create, apply and audit the implementation of a SU prophylaxis protocol in an Internal Medicine ward, over two years. Material and Methods: To this end, after reviewing the criteria for SU prophylaxis in medical patients in 2011, an audit was performed without previous notice followed by training of the clinical staff. In 2012 and 2013 new audits were carried out. Results: From 2011 to 2012, a statistically significant improvement in the guidance of patients was identified (57.8% to 70%), however, there was a statistically significant setback from 2012 to 2013 (52.5%). Discussion: The contributing factors for the improvement seen from the first to the second audit may have been the elaboration of the SU prophylaxis protocol along with staff training. Such improvement was dissipated in the third audit, probably because of the controversy that surrounds this subject and the absence of new training activities. Conclusion: This trial intends to remind that not all hospitalized patients have criteria for SU prophylaxis and that is important to define protocols adapted to the reality of each institution as well as maintaining permanent staff training."

Portugal is one of the European countries with the highest rate of antimicrobial drugs consumption and prevalence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, particularly MRSA. Objective: To identify the susceptibility profile of common bacteria isolated in the Microbiology Laboratory of Hospital Garcia de Orta (LM-HGO); publishing this information and encourage the use of antimicrobials drugs appropriate to the institution´s microbiological flora. Methods: Observational retrospective study of microorganisms commonly isolated in the LM-HGO in 2012 and analysis of their susceptibility profile. Compare to national data. Publish the data as a pocket guide. Results: We studied 4760 microorganisms, 40.5% related to community acquired infections and 59.5% to nosocomial infections. The majority (58.7%) was isolated from urine culture. The most frequent microorganisms isolated were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial susceptibility decreased considerably when matching community and nosocomial strains, in particular those of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. When compared at national level, the microorganisms isolated in the LM-HGO generally had a greater percentage of antimicrobial susceptibility, offset however, by the higher prevalence of MRSA. Conclusion: Multidrug resistance to antimicrobials is problematic in HGO. In addition to infection control measures, it is essential to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents. The knowledge of the susceptibility profile data of the institution´s microbiological flora contributes to selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial. The elaboration of a pocket guide with this information is pioneer in HGO and favors its application in clinical practice."

He had high inflammatory markers, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia. The urinary exam showed leukocyturia without urinary nitrites. Abdominal Computed Tomography revealed emphysematous nephritis with gas accumulation in the parenchyma area and a discrete gas area extending into the upper perirenal space in the form of tiny gas bubbles and thickening of the perirenal fascia. Afterwards, E. coli bacteremia was documented, sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam which was administered, but without any clinical improvement."

Functional outcome of the involved joint and patient survival depend mainly on early recognition and timely onset of the appropriate therapy. Despite the development and availability of laboratory and image tests, clinical suspicion remains the most important factor for a prompt diagnosis. Empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the host risk factors and the result of synovial fluid gram stain. Definitive diagnosis is achieved after isolating the pathogenic agent in synovial fluid. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly isolated agent and, in recent years, have witnessed the increased importance of the methicillin resistant strain. Most published guidelines on diagnostic approach and treatment management are based on expert consensus. It is essential to strengthen the importance of prompt diagnosis in order to reduce SA morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, authors consider relevant to review the clinical approach, additional diagnostic tests, treatment and management of complications. Only nongonococcal SA in the adult will be reviewed"

Surely this was a hard winter and the work at the Emergency Services is always difficult and chaotic. However, Internal Medicine doctors should work on the solution for actual problems in the Emergency Services. The organization models currently working at the Emergency Services have led to the breakup of each hospital into two different ones, one by doctors working on the emergency room and another by doctors working at the wards. Emergency Services teams, initially composed with competent and motivated doctors, have been worn-out by the difficult and exhausting work, leading many times to the rupture of their own teams, with the consequent loss of quality on their work. Ward teams are currently confined to night and weekend shifts and have learned to see the Emergency department has a non pleasant place to work. Resident doctors have also lost the feeling that the Emergency Services is a place to learn. Reorganization of hospital teams can lead to a better performance of Emergency Services. The implementation of a mix model, including doctors of emergency and ward teams, may have advantages for both groups of doctors and for residents. It is necessary to discuss and implement new measures, preparing for the next winter."

Nevertheless, this is a sub diagnosed disorder. Delirium has a negative impact on the primary disease, and worsens patients’ morbidity and mortality. As such, the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of Delirium are of paramount importance.Objectives: to study the incidence, risk factors and type of Delirium episodes amongst Internal Medicine inpatients.Methods: this was a prospective, observational study, which included all patients admitted in an Internal Medicine ward, during a two month period. The nursing team identified patients with Delirium, using the Confusion Assessment Method. An assessment was made of the risk factors, precipitating factors, type of disorder and need of medication.Results: during the study, 11% of our Internal Medicine inpatients had at least one episode of Delirium. All of these patients were over 65 years old and 75% were male. One third of the patients had 4 or more simultaneous risk factors. 63% of the Delirium episodes were of the hyperactive type and 73% of these needed medication.Conclusion: The incidence of episodes of delirium in our nursery was 11%. 63% was accompanied by hyperactive disorder. All patients had at least one factor risk which made them more vulnerable to this disease."

Eight days after admission he developed an oligoarthritis. Septic, crystal-associated and degenerative arthropathies were excluded and a diagnosis of C. difficile-induced reactive arthritis was assumed. The patient was treated with naproxen with rapid improvement.Conclusion: C. difficile-induced reactive arthritis share many characteristics of the other forms of reactive arthritis tough there are some particular epidemiological, clinical and pathophysiological features.

                    "The chaos in the emergency services (ES) occurs anytime the demand exceeds the implemented capacity, which is never enough when a hospital receives everyday during the winter more than double the usual number of patients. As long as the primary care services continue not to offer reasonable alternatives for the treatment of severe diseases, people will keep on flowing by the hundreds to the hospital emergency services, even if aware of the multiple hours of waiting ahead of them. They do not know whether the grievance they suffer from is something mild or if it is the indicator of a serious malady. They come to the emergency services because it is the only trustworthy door open, and because they fear for their lives. Another long-standing problem is the rapid exhaustion of hospitals’ capacity for hospitalisation, in connection to the rise of the needs of the ES. The specialisation of the health care teams is not the solution for the overloaded ES, although it has been suggested by believers of this system as if it were. In Portugal, as long as the patients arrive by the hundreds at the ES without any medical triage whatsoever, and more than 93% of the hospitalisations are conducted through the emergency services, it becomes essential that the doctor takes on a holistic approach, guaranteed by the internist. Only then can the quality of assistance and the institutional unity be assured, and the inadequate discharges avoided. This year, a combination of factors emerged, which resulted in the terrible outcome we have witnessed. The vaccine for the influenza was not as effective. The patients were older, they carried more diseases and presented many more social deficiencies, leading to a substantial increase in the need of hospitalisation. Economic austerity caused the reduction of the health care staff in terms of doctors and nurses, and robed them both of any rational motivation. It was only natural that a storm would begin to take form out of the first winds."

                    "Urinary tract Infections are highly prevalent. In Portugal, they represent the second most frequent community acquired infectious disease and the main hospital acquired infection in Internal Medicine wards. A great prevalence of antibiotic resistance may exist against the first line of recommended antibiotics for urinary tract infections. A retrospective analysis for a one year period was performed aiming to characterize the population of patients discharged from an Internal Medicine ward diagnosed with urinary tract infections. This population was assessed in terms of age, gender, type of urinary tract infection, etiologic agent, resistance profiles, prescribed antibiotics and associated diseases. From the results obtained, the authors state that 91% of urinary tract infections diagnoses corresponded to acute cystitis. The majority were community acquired (CAUTI) and 31% were hospital acquired (HAUTI). The etiologic agent was identified in 68% of performed urine cultures. 21 different spp were identified in the following order of frequency: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. There was low susceptibility to quinolones (19-20%), ampicillin (12-19%) and first generation cephalosporin (11%). The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were amoxicillin clavulanate, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The most prevalent associated diseases were diabetes, dementia and the presence of a chronic vesicle catheter. This work demonstrates high resistance to quinolones, ampicillin and first generation cephalosporins for CAUTI as for HAUTI this may be caused by the excessive use of these antibiotics in the last years. Ciprofloxacin was the second most prescribed antibiotic and the second most resistant one what reinforces the need of knowledge of the local microbial reality to adjust prescribing habits."

                    "Introduction: Nocardia is typically considered an opportunistic agent, causing disease in immunodepressed patients. Systemic Nocardia infection in a majority of the cases begins as a primary respiratory or cutaneous infection that can complicate with disseminated disease involving the central nervous system (CNS). Less than 10% of all cases of Nocardiosis result from primary CNS infection, and even more unusual is Nocardia infection in immunocompetent patients.Objective: This article presents a rare case of CNS Nocardia infection followed by systemic disease in a previously healthy patient.Results: Male patient, an agricultural engineer, admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) with fever, coughing, sputum and shortness of breath. During the previous year, the patient was diagnosed with Nocardia brain abscess. He was treated surgically with excision of the lesion, as well as with antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling. During this visit to the ER, on physical examination, the patient presented difficulty breathing and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Blood work indicated presences of inflammation; however, chest x-ray did not show any recent lesions. During his hospital stay, the patient continued to worsen. Bronchoscopy was performed and on bronchoalveolar lavage multi-resistant Nocardia was identified. Though correct measures were applied, the patient presented with respiratory exhaustion, eventually necessitating mechanical ventilation. Ultimately, the patient died after 124 days of hospital admission.Conclusion: Nocardia, a ubiquitous bacteria, rarely causes infection in healthy individuals. This clinical case illustrates a rare example of primary CNS Nocardia infection with secondary systemic involvement."

                    "Rashes in adults are one of the major diagnostic challenges. We present the case of a woman with 68 years with chronic diarrhea under study for 2 years and currently under a therapeutic trial with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for bowel excessive bacterial growth syndrome. Admitted in the ER with generalized rash compatible with major erythema multiforme (EM) associated with high fever (40ºC) and sphingo-thermal dissociation with three days of evolution. Given the drug exposure and typical lesions of EM, it appeared intuitive to assume a toxidermia but the complaints persisted. A review of the physical examination revealed herpetiform vesicular lesions on the hard palate hidden by the dental prosthesis. The diagnosis of major EM to Herpes simplex type 1 was then confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction of the vesicles and biopsy. After systemic treatment with acyclovir for 5 days there was rapid resolution of fever and total regression of lesions."

                    "Introduction and objective: Dengue Fever has been historically described in the literature at least since the 18th century. In the last few years viral transmission has intensified all over the world with an increasing incidence on dengue hemorrhagic fever due to a growing urban development, population growth, increased mobility and climatic changes. Aedes aegypti mosquito is the transmission vector. Most dengue infections are subclinical. There are 3 stages of disease: febrile, critical and the recovery phase. The most frequent signs and symptoms are: fever, facial flushing, musculoskeletal pain, retro orbital pain, photophobia and headache. Hemorrhagic diathesis can also happen. Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and liver impairment (increase on liver enzymes and delayed INR) are reported in most cases of dengue. The authors present cases of dengue requiring hospitalization during the first European epidemics of the 21st century. The aim of this study is to evaluate the demographic features, how the clinical condition has been evolving and manifesting itself, and its laboratory findings. Material and methods: a retrospective study of dengue cases diagnosed from the 1st September 2012 to the 31st December 2012 and requiring hospitalization, through the assessment of their clinical files. Results: 67 patients were admitted for hospitalization, forty three women and twenty four men. The mean age was 44 years. The symptoms leading most patients to seek medical help were: muscle pain (31 patients / 42.3%), nausea (18 patients / 26.9%), headache (17 patients / 25.4%), abdominal pain (7 patients / 10.4%), exanthema (5 patients / 7.5%), diarrhea (3 patients / 4.5%) and arthralgia (3 patients / 4.5%). Hepatic dysfunction was frequent, being present in 88% of the patients. Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia were present in 86.5% and 80.6% patients. The average length of time in hospital was 5 days. All patients received support care. There were no major complications. Conclusion: The characteristics of our population were similar to the other published series, although in Madeira Island only the serotype 1 virus was reported. The inexistence of other serotypes may explain the fact that there were no secondary infections and serious cases (hemorrhagic fever). Supportive care is the main form of treatment. A new epidemics with a different serotype probably will cause secondary infections, and Madeira Island must be prepared to face them in the best possible way."

                    "Homocystinuria due to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency is an inherited metabolic disease which leads to an accumulation of homocysteine in the blood and has been implicated in the occurrence of atherosclerotic disease and thromboembolic events in young adults. However, the neurologic manifestations of homocystinuria are numerous and not attributable solely to an atherosclerotic/thrombotic mechanism. We describe the cases of two siblings whose diagnosis was established in adulthood.A 37 year-old male, with a history of mental retardation, psychiatric disease and femoral-popliteal venous thrombosis developed, at the age of 34, encephalopathy, spastic tetraparesis and hyperreflexia. He was diagnosed with homocystinuria based on severe hyperhomocystinemia and MTHFR gene mutations. Partial clinical and laboratory remission were observed with folic acid, cobalamin, pyridoxine and restrictive diet.His sister, age 33, with a history of mild cognitive impairment and epilepsy was studied and the same genetic mutations were identified. Her homocysteine levels remained high despite being under the same treatment as her brother, and she developed persecutory paranoid delusions, spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia and altered proprioceptive sensitivity. In both cases the neuro-axis study showed patterns of diffuse leucoencephalopathy. Only with the introduction of betaine was an adequate metabolic and clinical control achieved. Despite marked reduction of homocysteinemia, the index case died of massive pulmonary thromboembolism. Homocystinuria must be considered in young adults with psychiatric and pyramidal symptoms. Despite being recognized as a hypercoagulability syndrome, there is insufficient clinical evidence to establish therapeutic guidelines with regards to anticoagulation in homocystinuria."

True cutaneous tuberculosis lesions can be acquired either exogenously (by direct inoculation of the skin by de Mycobacterium) or endogenously and show a wide spectrum of morphology.

These may be observed days or months after the acute poisoning. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, on imaging features and neuropsychological tests. It is important to exclude differential diagnoses. The authors describe a case of a 44-year-old man admitted with confusion, altered behavior and psychomotor agitation during 4 days, with no previous trauma or fever. He presented a history of severe CO poisoning three months prior to admission, without sequelae. On hospital admission the patient was disoriented, agitated, with attention deficit and hallucinatory activity. The cerebral CT scan revealed the presence of bilateral nonspecific pallidal hypodensities, suggestive of old lesions, consistent with CO poisoning on brain MRI. Metabolic, endocrine, toxic and infectious causes and also vitamin deficiencies were excluded. The neuropsychological screening tests revealed an impairment of higher brain functions, compatible with a Delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome.The authors emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment of acute CO poisoning highlighting the need for long term monitoring of these patients in order to identify late manifestations as early as possible."

Indeed, with regard to early diagnosis, the big issue will be the training of professionals and institutions enabling them to take care of a much larger number of persons infected within a relatively short time (it is estimated that in Portugal, there may be over a third of patients with regards to the total number of those who are already known, which means between 10 and 15.000 of new people infected with HIV, generally bringing a total of approximately 40 to 50.000 carriers throughout the country). With regard to early treatment, however, the questions that arise are much more complex and contentious, standing on three main levels: Its implications in the epidemiological dynamics at the community level (regional and global), and its repercussions in the long term, both in economic and financial fields and in health and, finally, the functional prognosis and life expectancy of each of the carriers of this infection that start early TARV, possibly after its respective serologic confirmation."

                    "Introduction: The precise incidence of Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in Portugal is unknown, being estimated in 50 000 to 100 000 cases per year, with a tendency to increase annually. Some criteria have been developed to predict the prognosis in CAP patients to help the physician decision where to treat the patient (outpatient versus inpatient), including the Pneumonia Severity Index 20 (PSI-20). Objectives: Assessing applicability of the PSI-20 risk classes, the indication for inpatient treatment in our population, demographic features and other factors influencing mortality. Methods: Retrospective study based on hospitalized patients´ clinical records assessment with CAP for two years in an Internal Medicine Service. Assessment of the PSI twenty variables and stratification of patients into risk classes I to V was performed.Results: we assessed 582 patients, 55% were male and 45% female, with an average age of 74.1 years old (± 14.9years). Mortality was similar in both genders and increased with age. Mortality was higher in patients coming from nursing homes, but was similar when comparing co-morbidities. The distribution among risk classes was: class I – 3.5%, class II – 4.2%, class III – 6.0%, class IV – 28.5% e class V – 57.7%. In our series, mortality was similar to the one predicted by the PSI-20. Initial antibiotic therapy was empirical. Conclusion: The algorithm to identify low-risk patients is applicable to our population. Based on the recommendations for inpatient treatment, most of the patients in risk class I, II and III could have been treated in an outpatient regimen. Mortality was higher among classes IV and V, as in the study by Fine et al. and subsequent validations."

We report the case of a 55-year-old woman, with previous conditions of severe asthma, lung tuberculosis and recurrent respiratory tract infections. In 2006 she was diagnosed with alveolitis and later in 2008 with rheumatoid arthritis. Due to worsening arthritis, she began Etanercept in November 2009, with improvement. About six months later, in May 2010, she was admitted due to Morganella morganii pneumonia, also with pancitopenia and relapsing arthritis. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. The patient was treated with liposomal Amphotericin B improving clinically. Careful monitoring of patients on biological therapies demands a high clinical suspicion to diagnose opportunistic infections that may limit future therapeutic options."

When the patient presents symptoms consistent with allergy, the physician must evaluate whether there is an allergic mechanism, choosing the most adequate test for the situation and which allergens are involved. The diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic diseases is based upon skin testing and/or specific serum IgE measurement. When skin tests are performed, it is important to use standardized allergen extracts, using positive and negative controls, having criteria of positivity and always integrate the results in the context of the clinical history. It is therefore important to train investigators/clinicians to performing such technique, because when correctly carried out, skin prick tests are the preferred method for the confirmation of allergen sensitivity."

All inpatients have an increased risk for VTE and there are several measures that can be used to prevent it. International guidelines recommend their use both in surgical patients as in medical patients. The aim of this study was to assess compliance with thromboprophylaxis institutional guidelines. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a Portuguese Hospital three years after guidelines were implemented there. For each patient, in the different departments for acute conditions, the authors studied the individual risk and the global guideline compliance. Out of 234 inpatients at the hospital, 25 were excluded. The patients were divided in two groups according to their condition being primarily a medical or surgical one. In our sample 80.4% of patients presented moderate/high risk of VTE. The compliance rate with institutional guidelines was: 75.3%; and 86.6% (in medical and surgical patients, respectively); reflecting a better compliance than reported in previous literature. However in patients at risk for VTE and heparin use contraindications only 9.7% underwent mechanical prophylaxis. This last issue represents an important field for future improvement.Key words: Venous thromboembolism; deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; low-molecular weight heparin."

The objective of this study is to characterize the population of our hospital area with a CVT diagnosis. Material and Methods: We used a non probability convenience sampling of patients admitted from the 1st January 2020 to the 31st December 2010, having in their discharge records a diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. A retrospective, observational and descriptive study where the respective clinical files were assessed. Results: We have identified 20 patients, all Caucasians, aged between 18 and 82 years, with a mean age of 50.4 years, being 80% females. Most had subacute progression (onset of symptoms between 48 hours to 30 days prior to diagnosis). Headache was the most common initial symptom (85%), and in 15% of patients it was the only symptom. The diagnosis was achieved through cranial CAT Scan in 55% of cases. The superior sagittal sinus, the left side sinus and right side sinus were the most often affected. Treatment was made with anticoagulants in 75% of cases. Full recovery occurred in 85% of patients and 10% patients died. We found recurrent thrombotic events in 10% of patients. The most common sequelae were headache (45%). The risk factor most frequently found was oral contraceptives (35%). The etiology remained unknown in 20% of cases. In 5 patients were identified more than one cause for the CVT. Conclusion: In this work the authors intend to raise the alert to an entity that requires a large clinical suspicion for the diagnosis."

The screening revealed mild anemia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated CRP. She was admitted with a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome to investigate the etiology. A skin biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils), confirming the diagnosis. Further laboratory tests were carried out including myelography. After colonoscopy with biopsy, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Treatment with prednisolone led to a rapid improvement of symptoms and regression of skin lesions. The Sweet's syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare entity. The etiology is unknown but probably results from a hypersensitivity reaction, leading to cytokine production with subsequent activation and infiltration by neutrophils. Crohn's disease is one of several systemic diseases that can be the basis of Sweet's syndrome, although associations are rare. The authors report another case of this rare association and originality of the case is still at the age of diagnosis of Crohn's disease."

In such cases is regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome.The authors present the case of a 51 years-old man, admitted because of progressive dysphagia of recent onset. He was previously asymptomatic. Physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. A slight enlargement of the mediastinum was noted on chest radiography. Thoracic CT-scan revealed a tumor of the anterior mediastinum. Upper gastroesophageal endoscopy and echoendoscopy were normal. A disorder of esophageal motility was then suspected. The electromyography revealed signs of Myasthenia gravis. Treatment with pyridostigmine was started and dysphagia disappeared. Biopsy of mediastinal tumor under thoracoscopy confirmed a thymoma. The patient was treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and later tumoral excision was performed. Since then a marked improvement was noted."

He had a history of mild cognitive impairment and epilepsy diagnosed when he was 18-years-old. He had been followed up in the Neurology clinic and medicated with sodium valproate. His previous brain CT showed \"subependymal nodules\" and cortical tuber. Physical examination noted the presence of facial and periungual fibromas and hypomelanosis macule on the trunk. Abdominal-pelvic CT showed \"solid nodules and cysts in both kidneys”. Abdominal--pelvic MRI did not clarify the nature of renal nodules. A biopsy of one nodule located in the lower pole of left kidney was performed. The histological study was compatible with the diagnosis of angiomyolipoma. The diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis was established based on the combination of major criteria (facial angiofibroma, periungual fibroma, subependymal nodules, cortical tuber, renal angiomyolipoma) and one minor criterion (multiple renal cysts)."

The diagnosis is often delayed because it is seldom suspected, the clinical-laboratorial condition is nonspecific leading to a poorer prognosis. We report a case of a 59-year-old man, hospitalized for an occlusive syndrome progressing for a week. The abdominal CT scan showed bowel loops distention and a moderate volume of ascites, retroperitoneal and mesenteric adenopathies and peritoneal thickening. Then, the patient developed fever of undetermined cause, refractory to multiple antibiotic schemes. Colonoscopy, tumor markers, microbiology and serologies were negative or normal. At the 55th day of hospitalization the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, defining a diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. In the majority of patients with TPe serum-ascites albumin gradient is <1,1, with predominance of lymphocytes in the fluid. The direct and cultural tests are positive at 2,5 and 20% of cases, respectively. The exploratory laparoscopy has sensitivity and specificity of approximately 95% and should be performed early."

                    "Nosocomial Pneumonias are the second most prevalent nosocomial infections. Assessing local risk factors for multidrug-resistant microorganisms is essential for an adequate empirical antibiotic therapy. The authors present a retrospective study based on the review of nosocomial pneumonia cases through their clinical files for a period of one year. A total of 168 cases were identified (73.8% Healthcare-Associated Pneumonias – HCAP; 22.6% Hospital Acquired Pneumonias – HAP; and 3.6% Ventilation--Associated Pneumonias). Empirical antibiotics directed against classical “community bacteria” were used in 69.6% of the cases; 36.7% of these had to be changed later. A pathogen was identified in 43.4% of the cases in which an etiological investigation was carried out. 38.9% of the respiratory secretions cultures were positive. The most prevalent microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 13.9% of all nosocomial pneumonias in which an etiological investigation was carried out. It seems there is a higher risk of multidrug-resistant microorganisms in the subgroup of HCAP with an admission less than 90 days before and in the subgroup of late-onset HAP. The 30 day mortality rate was 46%. This study has the limitation of being retrospective. It served as a starting point for a prospective investigation that is now being performed."

There are four main forms of Leishmaniasis disease: cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Authors present the case of a 41 year-old woman, immunocompetent, admitted for fever and pancytopenia, associated with anorexia, asthenia and 17 kg weight loss in seven months. Investigation revealed to be a visceral leishmaniasis. The treatment was started with liposomal amphotericin B, getting a good clinical and analytic response. The disease subsided after nine months of follow-up. This case emphasizes the importance of considering a diagnosis of leishmaniasis, especially in non--endemic areas, and the need of exam reevaluation when the diagnosis is not clear in first approach."

                    "Background: There are some reports of paradoxical inflammation phenomena associated with anti-TNF therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study has been to evaluate the incidence of paradoxical inflammation phenomena in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with infliximab (IFX).Methods: The authors carried out a retrospective analysis of 64 patients with IBD (55 with Crohn disease (CD) and 9 with ulcerative colitis (UC)). They were interviewed and clinical processes reviewed in order to identify possible adverse effects associated with this therapy. Interim acute infusion reactions were excluded.Results: In the 64 patients included, 38 were males with a mean age of 39 years. In our group of patients, the major indication for biological therapy was the presence of active disease (78.1%). The mean duration of the treatment was 4 years (1-11). 78.1% were taking 5 mg/Kg and the frequency of infusions was every 8 weeks in 70.3%. 20.3% of patients were treated with azathioprine and 26.6% with aminosalicylates. We observed paradoxical inflammation events in 21 patients. The most common changes were skin reactions (folliculitis, eczema, psoriasis), followed by arthritis/arthralgia, lupus and auto-immune hepatitis. In 6 patients (28.6%) IFX had to be suspended in order to solve the reaction (1 hepatitis, 2 lupus and 3 patients with psoriasis) and specific therapy to this complication was started. The effects were more frequent in the group of patients taking 10 mg/kg (p=0.17) and less frequent with the concomitant use of azathioprine (p=0.22). Conclusions: In this study, paradoxical inflammation events were frequent, although those requiring drug withdrawal were relatively rare. Paradoxical inflammatory events should be treated with systemic therapy directed to the reaction and in most cases it may lead drug withdrawal. Once under control, it is possible restart biologic therapy (with another anti-TNF agent or even the same in a lower dosage) to maintain remission in IBD."

                    "β-Thalassemia is one of the most common hemoglobinopathies in the world, characterized by the absence or decrease on the β-hemoglobin chain production. The coexistence of β-Thalassemia and lymphoma is rare, but it has been reported in the literature, associated with better treatment approaches of β-Thalassemia major. In this article, it is reported a case of β-Thalassemia minor presented with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing the first documented case in Portugal and the second worldwide. Several factors, still controversial, may contribute to the pathogenesis of malignant disease in β-Thalassemia: infections, iron overload, immunomodulation and more intensive hematopoiesis to compensate ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolysis, increasing the probability of mutations, including oncogene expression. Based on a literature review, it is argued that the term that most likely relates these two entities is “association” and not “coincidence”."

Gram-negative bacilli, which were formerly the main microorganisms causing intra-hospital infections, have been replaced by gram-positive cocci, essentially Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The increasing number of staphylococcal infections, especially those associated with the use of peripheral or central venous catheters, by the increase in parenteral nutrition and by the use of pacemakers and prosthetic materials poses an important challenge to the treating physician. Since most of these infections are associated with bacteremia and septicemia, blood cultures are one of the most valuable complementary methods for a quick diagnosis. We will review the most useful microbiological parameters that can be applied when interpreting a blood culture isolate (especially if a CNS is isolated). We will also briefly explain the different causes of catheter-related bacteremia and the different rates of contamination and infection associated with the various percutaneous intravascular devices."

It can lead to serious complications such as ulceration, necrosis and gangrene, and ultimately digital amputation.Raynaud’s phenomenon can be primary, when it is not associated with any disease or condition, or secondary. Its correct clinical orientation is crucial since, in many cases it could be the first sign of a serious underlying disease. In recent years, advances in the study of its pathophysiology led to the emergence of new therapeutic options.In this article we intend to review its pathogenesis, clinical guidance and available treatments."

Appropriate recommendations include: upper gastrointestinal disease or NSAID-induced gastropathy.The aims of this study were to determine the frequency and the predictive factors for inappropriate administration of AST on admission, during the hospitalization and on discharge to the general practice and to determine the costs to the health care system.Methods: A retrospective review of clinical files was carried out from the 1st of January to 30th of June of 2010 in our Internal Medicine department. The medications used were esomeprazole, ranitidine and sucralfate.Results: we assessed 511 patients with a mean age of 80.5years. 30% of the patients took AST before admission. Their use was inappropriate in 69% of them. Among hospitalized patients, 89% of patients started AST during the hospitalization, and these 76% were unnecessary. At discharge, 48% of patients used AST, and most of them (61%) had no such indication.The inappropriate administration of AST increases the cost per patient.Conclusion: Results agree with the literature, with a high frequency of incorrect AST prescription. A more accurate use of AST is recommended to avoid side effects and to reduce costs."

Both protease inhibitors (PI) and, to a lesser extent, nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) appear to be involved, through direct metabolic effects of PI and an indirect effect of PI and NRTI. This definitions, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, exist to identify those “at risk” and, although treatment is commonly recommended, antidiabetic therapy is likely to be of greater benefit in those patients with a greater perceived cardiovascular risk and the lowest risk of HIV disease progression. The most effective strategies for the treatment of diabetes in patients under HAART appear to be IP switching and/or initial antidiabetic therapy administration, with metformin or tioglitazones; however, all oral antidiabetics have their role in this patient’s type and are not significant interactions between different antidiabetics and antiretroviral therapy were described until now."

However, many of the biblical narratives are based in events that took place, surviving for several centuries through oral tradition from one generation to the other being written down at a later stage, according to a vision coherent with the religious and cultural context of the time. Thus, the plagues described in Jews exodus from Egypt constitute a palimpsest of different epidemical outbreaks correlated mainly with climatic changes that occurred then in the Middle East."

In Portugal no studies have objectively analysed the prevalence of such patients in Internal Medicine wards. This study aimed to characterize palliative care needs in Internal Medicine wards of a Central/University Hospital, to define the profile of patients, determining their needs and assessing the adequacy of care. Material and Methods: Prospective and observational study including 670 patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward of a Central/University Hospital in a period of 9 consecutive weeks. Selection of patients in need of Palliative Care who answered a questionnaire and a review of clinical files aiming to assess several variables, namely, disease leading to the need of palliative care, reason for admission, performance status, symptoms/symptom control measures and special care in agony.Results: The study determined palliative care needs in 15% of the hospitalized patients (54 cancer patients and 48 non cancer patients), that presented multiple and intense symptoms, requiring complex therapy and extensive nursing care. Although most symptoms have improved there was insufficient symptomatic control, especially of anorexia, fatigue, depression and anxiety. There was also difficulty in the recognition of agony (achieved in only 1/3 of patients) and institution of the appropriate attitudes and therapeutic measures, with maintenance of futile therapy. Mortality was 31.3%. Of the patients discharged from the hospital only 3 were admitted in palliative care units. Conclusion: This study illustrates in an objective way the need for palliative care in Internal Medicine wards and points to the importance of specific training of Internists in this particular area."

A quarter of patients had a medical history of ischemic stroke. The frequency of bedridden state, before admission, was 19.2%. Acute ischemic stroke was the commonest primary diagnosis. The mean length of hospital stay was 15 days and increased to 23 days for nonmedical reasons (social problems).

Clinical features are anemia, bone pain, renal failure and hypercalcemia. Rarely, a bacterial infection is the initial presentation of this disease. We report a case in which bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, possibly associated to Septic Arthritis (SA), was the initial presentation of multiple myeloma. This situation has been seldom reported in medical literature. Association between pneumococcal infection and a specific predisposing disease is common. Pneumococcal infection should lead to a suspicion of underlying illness and the co-existence of other diseases must be ruled out in the diagnosis, namely multiple myeloma."

Physical exam revealed an ulcerated swelling tumor, approximately 9cmx8cm, with irregular and friable surface in the left foot and multiple pigmented painful nodules in the scalp and ipsilateral leg. Analytical data: anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and alterations of liver function tests. Imaging study revealed: pulmonary, pleural, liver and bone metastases with D11 fracture; mediastinal adenopathies; pre-vertebral mass with invasion of the right internal jugular vein and cranial bones. Upper gastrointestinal Endoscopy showed gastric ulcers and duodenal brown stain. Biopsies of gastric and skin lesions: melanoma metastases. Diagnosis of melanoma was made, stage IV, M1c.

                    "Introduction: The HIV infection / AIDS is still an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, where only a restricted number of patients have antiretroviral therapy available. In developed countries there is a trend to epidemics stabilization. Nevertheless, late stage diagnosis is still very frequent, overcoming the benefits of treatment early onset. Portugal is the Western European country with the highest prevalence of HIV infection, presenting an increasing number of new cases.Objective and Methods: We retrospectively characterized and compared two groups of patients with HIV infection followed in an outpatient clinic of a Lisbon hospital. The first group included patients that had been diagnosed in 1997/1998, and the second group included patients diagnosed in 2007/2008. Our purpose was to ascertain any differences between the groups concerning demography, epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and therapy. Results: We evaluated 74 patients diagnosed with HIV infection in 1997/1998 and 106 diagnosed in 2007/2008. The average age at the time of diagnosis was higher in 2007/2008 (37.8 vs 33.1 years). The male gender was predominant in both periods, without significant difference. There were more foreign patients in 2007/2008 (50% vs. 20.3%). There was an increase in heterosexual transmission (65.1% vs. 48.6%) and a decreased number of cases associated with injection drug use (3.8% vs. 32.4%) in 2007/2008. There were no significant differences of patients diagnosed on initial stage C between the two groups. In the 1997/1998 period, patients needed to take a higher number of pills distributed by a higher number of times per day. Conclusions: The investment in strategies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and early diagnosis is crucial. With a more effective prevention and an early institution of antiretroviral therapy, we expect to become more effective, easier and safer, day by day, and perhaps one day we will achieve the epidemic control. Key words: HIV infection, AIDS, epidemiology, transmission, prevention, behaviour, antiretroviral therapy."

He presented progressive fatigue, pallor, and reduced exercise capacity, without changing bowel habits, apparent hematic stool losses or recent weight loss. Laboratory studies showed: Hb 8.1g/dL; MCV 66.9 fl; MCH 19.8 pg; RDW 19%; anisocytosis and poikilocytosis; iron 16 mcg/dL; transferrin 404 mg/dL; ferritin 2.75ng/mL; reticulocyte count 2.8%. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI) and colonoscopy revealed no bleeding lesions. Hb level ranged between 8 and 13 g/dl, with low levels of ferritin even after parenteral iron therapy was started. Additional tests carried out showed that antigliadin, antiendomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were negative, and an endoscopic biopsy of small intestine mucosa was normal; fecal occult blood test was negative. Small bowel cineradiography showed an inflammatory aspect at duodenum and jejunum, and a capsule endoscopy showed horseshoe necrotic bleeding lesions at that level. Surgical exploration with enteroscopy defined a solitary lesion on the jejunum that was removed, and a small bowel adenocarcinoma was identified in the biopsy."

Severe hyponatremia was found (Na+ 113 mEq/L), along with low serum osmolarity, normal urinary osmolarity, urinary ionogram and urinalysis. He started intravenous fluid therapy to correct the natremia. The chest and brain computed tomography scans were normal, the abdominal ultrasound showed signs of chronic liver disease. The hormonal study showed decreased levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone and thyroxine; triiodothyronine, thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactine were normal.The pituitary magnetic resonance imaging revealed intra-adenomatous hemorrhagic lesion, establishing the diagnosis of hypophyseal apoplexy. Since surgery was not recommended,he started hydrocortisone and levothyroxine therapy with clinical and analytic improvement. This case shows how important it is to ascertain hyponatremia etiology."

This case report is about a rare presentation of Clostridium difficile infection: toxic megacolon. It is a life-threatening complication which requires early recognition and prompt treatment with intravenous metronidazole, oral vancomycin and vancomycin enema. A case of an 88-year-old woman who had abdominal distension, high-grade fever and profuse watery diarrhea after treatment of a urinary tract infection with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is presented. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed an impressive colon dilation, consistent with toxic megacolon. Stool enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile was positive. Despite aggressive medical treatment, she died 8 hours after admission. Since most cases of C. difficile are both iatrogenic and nosocomial, every effort should be made to avoid indiscriminate use of antibiotics."

The echocardiogram presented biatrial dilation, severe left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy and mild LV systolic dysfunction. Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed hepatosplenomegaly and large volume ascites. Readmitted two months later with symptoms worsening. A new echocardiogram was performed, revealing, besides the referred changes, a transmitral flow with a restrictive pattern. Cardiac catheterization excluded coronary disease. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed fibroelastosis lesions and nuclear hypertrophy, without initial evidence of amyloid deposition. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) revealed bi-ventricular hypertrophy and a pattern of late gadolimium enhancement (LGE) suggestive of restrictive cardiomyopathy (amyloidosis). Abdominal fat biopsy identified amyloid substance by Congo red-stain.The diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy is difficult. Although endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard, CMRI arises as a non-invasive method useful to determine cardiomyopathies etiology due to its capacity of characterizing tissue through LGE."

When these lesions reoccur for three or more episodes per year, are named as Recurrent Oral Ulceration (ROU). Although recurring ulcers might be associated with other disorders, ROU usually expresses a primary problem.The main objectives of this study were 1) to determine the prevalence of ROU in the general Portuguese population, composed by people randomly approached without any acute disease; 2) to compare the observed prevalence with the prevalence of ROU in other countries and 3) to compare the prevalence of this problem in patients with other systemic diseases where ROU is included. A population of six hundred persons was enquired regarding the age of the disease onset; place of residence, factors triggering outbreaks, usual treatments and family incidence. Besides, it was carried out the identification of other diseases associated with ROU as well as the relevant pathological background. The prevalence of ROU was 19.0% in this general population, with predominance of 22.7% in women, compared with 14.0% in men, being this difference statistically significant (p<0.05). In most of the affected individuals, the first ulceration appeared before the twenties. Certain food, oral trauma, stress, fever, menstrual cycle, presence of acute disease, some medications/drugs and smoking cessation have been identified as precipitation factors associated with ROU. In 9.6% of the affected people it was not possible to identify any cause for recurrent ulcers. We also found that 45.6% of the population with ROU has direct relatives, up to first degree, also affected by this problem"

                    "Introduction and objective:Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a historically well defined entity, however, the advance of scientific knowledge has proven to be a heterogeneous syndrome, with multiple variants, each one with distinct clinical features and specific pathophysiology. Except for theMiller-Fishervariant of GBS, it is characterized bythe absence of osteotendinous reflexes and ascending flaccid muscle paralysis of variable magnitude, which may progress to respiratory failure by paralysis of respiratory muscles. Analytically, the main characteristic finding is the cerebro-spinal-fluid albumin-cytologic dissociation. The electromyogram helps the diagnosis, but it’s more useful in identifying the clinical variant. The authors present the cases of GBS requiring hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in our hospital. The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographic, clinical disease, type of variant and response to therapy. We also analyzed the complications and hospitalization time and its relation to the clinical variant of the disease.Material and Methods: A retrospective study of GBS cases diagnosed in the last 10 years, requiring hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (from the 31st January 2001 to the 31st January 2011), through the analysis of their clinical files.Results: Of the twenty-one patients diagnosed with GBS in the selected period,seven patients required admission to the ICU, all due to respiratory failure. It were five men and two women. The mean age was 50.8 years. A precipitating event was identified in two patients. Four patients evolved rapidly (less than 5 days to hospitalization in ICU) and all of these had axonal variants. There were signs of autonomic dysfunction in 43% of patients. All had albumincytologic dissociation. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) was 24.4 days, and this was higher in axonal forms.The average time of stay in ICU and hospital were, respectively, 29.7 days and 93.4 days, being higher in axonal forms. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin. There were no complications associated with treatment.Conclusion:Axonal variants are associated with a quicker disease progression and severe neurological deficits, which are reflected in prolonged time of MV and hospitalization. These are also associated with lower recovery rates and increased morbidity and mortality.Treatment was directed towards modifying the course of the disease, and in this respect both plasmapheresis and intravenous human immunoglobulin have similar efficacy. Supportive care, including respiratory care and treatment of autonomic dysfunction are extremely important to avoid potentially fatal complications."

They were also asked whether the vaccine had been proposed and administered and if any local and/or systemic side effects had emerged. Patients who took the vaccine, were assessed regarding the effect of the disease activity on a numerical scale from 0 (no active disease) to 10 (very active) the month before and after vaccination.Results: Of 318 SLE patients followed in the Unit, 186 (mean age 43 ± 13; 91% female) were contacted. Vaccination was offered to 37% of them (68) and was administered to 28 patients (41%). 72% of vaccinated patients had local adverse reactions and 31% systemic. No influenza infection was diagnosed in vaccinated patients. The mean global assessment of disease activity in the month preceding and following the administration of the vaccine was 3. The mean scale variation was 0.Conclusion: Despite the Health Portuguese Department recommendations for H1N1 vaccine, a significant number of SLE patients were not vaccinated either because they had not been proposed to, either by their poor compliance. Although a significant incidence of local and systemic side effects there was no change in SLE activity."

A dorsal meningioma surgery had been performed 5 months before admission. Spondylodiscitis was diagnosed by lumbar spine magnetic resonance. Enterococcus faecalis was identified in several cultured samples. Aortic valve endocarditis was also detected. After a long treatment with appropriate antibacterial agents the evolution was favorable.The association of spondylodiscitis with endocarditis occurs in about 15% of endocarditis cases. Being Enterococcus faecalis infection a frequent cause of endocarditis, the association of spondylodiscitis with endocarditis due to this microorganism is surprisingly rare."

                    "Many publications show an incidence increase of Clostridium difficile (CD) associated disease (CDAD), affecting both in- and outpatients being these recent infections more severe and difficult to treat. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the incidence and clinical impact of CDAD in patients hospitalized from the 1st January 2004 to the 31st December 2009. Suggestive clinical manifestations and at least one of the following were the inclusion criteria: CDAD compatible colonoscopy or CD positive toxin. We identified 83 cases of CDAD (32M, 51W), in a total of 9581 patients (5198M, 4383W). Age ranging from 47 to 94 years (average 79). Five patients had CDAD acquired in the community and 78 in hospital environment. The incidence of CDAD increased almost six fold between 2004 and 2009 (4.35/1000 vs. 21.63/1000), and 77.11% developed the disease during hospitalization. The disease was more frequent in women (11.64/1000 vs. 6.16/1000). All patients had undergone prior antibiotherapy. The comorbidities, number of antibiotics used, advanced age, duration of the antibiotherapy and the length of hospitalization did not seem to justify the increase in incidence and severity. In 96% the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of Clostridium toxin and in 4% by colonoscopy. Seventy three patients (88%) were treated with metronidazole and 30% died (the department overall mortality was 13%). Probably, it was the advanced age related with the worst severity scenario which caused the high mortality in our cases."

                    "Introduction: Paraquat is a contact herbicide commercially available since 1962. Paraquat intoxication (PI) is usually voluntary and highly lethal, since there is no effective antidote. Toxicity occurs through cyclic redox reactions, damaging mainly the kidneys and lungs.Aim, material and methods: featuring the clinical presentation, management and outcome of patients with PI over an 18 years period (from the 01st January 1993 to the 31st December 2010) through the retrospective analysis of clinical files and comparing the survivors and the deceased.Results: Thirty-one cases of Paraquat intoxication were included, with a male: female ratio 1:1. Age range from 13 to 80 years, mean age 42.4years (±18.7).All intoxications were voluntary and by oral route. There was statistical difference in the amount ingested (22.1 mL vs. 72.7 mL, p<0.0005). A non-significant trend to a longer delay until getting medical attention in the deceased group (1.6 h vs. 3.2 h, p=0.091). Statistical significance was found between mortality and leukocytosis, hypocapnea, hypoxemia, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and AST. There was no difference between groups according to treatment options, although hemocarboperfusion was used more often in the deceased group (53.9% vs. 66.7%, p=0.471) and corticosteroids in the survivor group (61.5% vs. 44.4%, p=0.350). Mortality rate was 58.1% (66.7% in the first 72 hours), due to respiratory insufficiency and multiple organ failure. Variable levels of pulmonary fibrosis occurred in 38.5% of the survivors.Discussion & Conclusion: Paraquat intoxication has a poor prognosis with limited efficiency of treatment approaches. The relation between Paraquat in the urine and the time elapsed after ingestion is the main determinant factor in the prognosis. In this study the presence of dyspnea, hypocapnea and hypoxemia was linked to a bad prognosis. There was no statistical difference between the available treatment options."

The authors report a case of a 22 year old black female patient, with no relevant past medical history, admitted with a 15 day ongoing complaints of high fever, associated with profuse sweating and discrete cervical and axillary lymphadenopathies.After performance of several negative or inconclusive diagnostic studies, an excisional biopsy of a cervical node showed a morphologic pattern suggesting Kikuchi´s disease. Differential diagnosis with lymphoma, tuberculosis and systemic erythematosus lupus was then made. Repetition of EBV serologies, as an outpatient, confirmed a likely association of this virus with the disease, with descending titters."

                    "Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a worldwide infection including multiple clinical syndromes, increasingly recognized as an opportunistic infection, associated with immunosuppression conditions, particularly HIV infection. Fever, constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and pancytopenia are the most characteristic features. Ocular involvement with intra-retinal haemorrhage is very rare.Diagnosis can be difficult as parasite identification is not always possible, serological tests have suboptimal sensitivity, and molecular biology techniques, like Polymerase Chain Reaction, are often unavailable in clinical practice.Except in India, antimonial drugs have been first choice therapy, although there is a trend towards Amphotericin in immunocompromised patients.In this case-report we present a 35-years-old patient, resident in an endemic area of the disease, HIV-seronegative, with a longstanding condition of constitutional symptoms, fever, massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Attempts to isolate the parasite were of no avail; there was no evidence of another disease, and serological tests results for Leishmania were positive and strongly suggestive of active infection. Just before beginning antimony treatment, the patient mentioned blurred vision and an ophthalmologic examination showed bilateral retinal haemorrhages. Full ocular and clinic laboratorial recovery ensued along the treatment course.We report this case due to the unusual ocular lesions in VL and complexity issues concerning the diagnosis. With this paper we also want to remind that, in spite of its rarity in developed countries, VL should not be underestimated in a patient with a suggestive clinical condition."

At physical examination he had sparse rhonchi in pulmonary examination and an abdominal mass. Image exams showed abdominal adenopathies extending to the thorax and a micronodular pattern on both lung fields. Transbronchial biopsy showed hyaline material compatible with amyloidosis; similar findings were made in a peripheral adenopathy and in an abdominal fat pad biopsy. The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were normal, and there were no monoclonal peaks in serum and urinary immune-electrophoresis. The immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for k light chains.

The ALERT system is a rapidly growing EMR in the whole world, and is the most used EMR in public hospitals in Portugal.Methods: we reviewed current articles on information technology benefits to health care carrying out a critical evaluation of our ongoing experience with the ALERT system.Results: among the several functionalities proven to be beneficial on an EMR, the ALERT systems have two: recording and conveying information as well as therapy and additional tests prescriptions. There are several dysfunctions on these two functionalities, as well as on other areas of the system.Conclusions: the ALERT system is an EMR in need of improvement on three main areas: the user interface, its function on therapy guidance and the ability to respond to the user’s demands."

This was a retrospective study from September 2007 to August 2008. 761 demands from 619 patients on human albumin were analyzed. Patients were in average aged 58.1 +/-14.7 years, where 510 were male (77%). Other parameters were also assessed: total proteins, serum albumin, serum creatinine, INR, obtained at the date of request. From a total of 556.831 bottles of albumin requested, only 5033 (0.9%) were actually administered. Patients with liver diseases were the majority (60%), and 36% of the requests were in accordance with the scientific evidence. The main cause for albumin prescription was hypoalbuminaemia (53%). We conclude that grounds for prescribing albumin should be better thought through, and a more restrictive policy for albumin supply from the pharmaceutical department is entirely justified."

Prognosis depends on early diagnosis and correct treatment.Objectives: Evaluate all patients with LA admitted in an Internal Medicine Department for a period of ten years. Methods: retrospective, event driven, clinical database analysis. Risk factors, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging studies were verified as well as microbiology tests, pathogen identification, treatment and clinical evolution.Results: a total of 16 patients with LA were admitted. The most frequent risk factors were biliary and abdominal surgery, alcohol habits and diabetes. Clinical presentation was more frequently acute and common manifestations were fever, chills and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Most frequent laboratory abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, increase on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C–reactive protein, decrease on albumin and increase on aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl-transpeptidase. Ultrasound and computed tomography were performed in the majority of patients. Blood cultures, performed in all patients, were positive in five. Serological tests were positive in 3 patients. Needle aspiration was performed in half of the patients, with inconclusive results. Eight patients went through percutaneous catheter drainage. Antibiotics were administered for a mean duration of 33.8 days. There was a good clinical response in 15 patients and one case of recurrence.Conclusions: the profile of our patients with LA was similar to those referred in the literature, however the pathogen identification was only achieved in half of them. There was a low diagnostic sensitivity with needle aspiration, nevertheless good response to treatment and favorable outcome were noted."

                    "Background: The diagnosis of complex atheromatosis of the aortic arch, a potential source of cerebral emboli, is made by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Although a correlation has been found between carotid and aortic atherosclerosis, it is not known how reliably the results of the carotid ultrasound evaluation can predict the presence of atheromatosis of the aortic arch. Methods: We prospectively studied all patients referred to our laboratory simultaneously for TEE and carotid ultrasound, with the diagnosis of acute ischemic CVA. We evaluated the capacity of an increased carotid intimal-media thickness (IMT) or the presence of carotid high-risk atherosclerotic plaques to predict the presence of complex atheromatosis of the aortic arc. Results: A total of 101 ischemic stroke patients were sent to our laboratory for TEE and carotid ultrasound. Considering the presence of complex atheromatosis of the aortic arch as the dependent variable, increased carotid IMT had a sensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 78% (positive predictive value 41%, negative predictive value 80%), and carotid high-risk plaques had a sensitivity of 22% and a specificity of 95% (positive predictive value 60%, negative predictive value 77%).Conclusions: In this study, a carotid ultrasound scan with an abnormal IMT or high-risk plaques had a high specificity for the presence of complex atheromatosis of the aortic arch, with a low sensitivity."

Clinically a triad of abdominal pain, ascites and liver enlargement, which is very unspecific, was described.The therapeutic options are made of medical procedures and invasive relief of such obstruction. Isolated procedures are only recommended if there is no liver necrosis.TIPS has proven to be an effective portosystemic derivative approach with lower mortality than surgical shunts."

Methods: The authors present a case of a 70 years old female inpatient at the Department of Internal Medicine. She had complaints of fatigue, anorexia, worsening of dyspnoea, generalized itching (without skin changes), recurrent tremors, sweating and episodes of fever. At the time of admission were considered, as differential diagnoses, occult abscesses and neoplasm. After conducting several tests and nephrectomy was possible to make the diagnosis of Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Discussion / Conclusions: XGP is a form of renal chronic infection and surrounding tissues, first described in 1916 by Schlagenhaufer with the name of “staphylomycosis” (due to its similarity to actinomyces and the presence of staphylococci), characterized by destruction of renal parenchyma by macrophages containing lipids. Gross pathological changes include increasing of the kidney (sometimes massive), lithiasis, peripelvic fibrosis, hydronephrosis and lobulated yellow masses replacing the renal parenchyma."

Genetic, endocrine, neuroendocrine, behavioral and environmental factors play an important role in their etiopathogenesis. The diagnosis is made based on the body mass index and waist circumference. The prevention and treatment are necessary, since an excessive morbidity and mortality can be linked to obesity and its associated disorders mainly cardiovascular and metabolic. Proper nutrition and increased physical activity are the main focus of these measures. Adjuvant pharmacological intervention (orlistat) is recommended for patients with concomitant overweight- or obesity-related diseases and for whom diet and physical activity have not been successful. Bariatric surgery is reserved for patients with severe obesity or those with moderate obesity associated with a serious medical condition, after at least one year of an inefficient conservative treatment. The purpose of this review is to assess all these aspects."

The introduction of natriuretic peptides in the clinical practice allowed a quicker diagnosis, less delay to start treatment and lower mortality for inpatients. In terms of therapy there has been no significant progress. As a matter of fact, loop diuretics and vasodilator agents are still the mainstay of therapy in this situation. The new drugs introduced in the clinical practice had their use limited by concerns regarding their safety, like nesiritide and levosimendan, or their efficacy, like tolvaptan. Both ultrafiltration and specialized heart failure units had a better outcome but their implementation has been limited due to logistic problems.The disease has a somber prognosis. In order to stratify the risk whilst determining which patients will benefit from aggressive therapy, several clinical factors, especially renal impairment, and several biomarkers, like natriuretic peptides, ST2 protein, troponins and galectina, have been studied."

We carried out an audit to identify a faulty practice and to plan strategies to provide the best care.The audit was performed in the first quarter of 2008. All patients to whom oxygen was administered or prescribed were included. All the process of oxygen therapy, from medical prescription through nursing transcription, administration and medical and nursing monitoring, had to be in accordance with the recommendations of “Guideline for emergency oxygen use in adult patients: Summary of draft guideline” by the British Thoracic Society. The administration of oxygen while patients were transported, having meals, in hygiene and using humidifiers was also audited.A total of 472 episodes of oxygen therapy were audited, corresponding to 178 patients. There was a medical prescription of oxygen in 97.7% of the audited episodes. A complete “fixed dose” oxygen prescription was present in only 51.2%. Just 51.1% episodes of oxygen administration fully respected the transcription. Monitoring was the same as transcribed in 86.7% episodes.Oxygen therapy, although being a common treatment in most hospitals for acute conditions, is not implemented according to international recommendations of care. There are practices to improve in oxygen prescription, transcription, administration and monitoring. Clinical audit is an excellent tool to recognising and improving the quality of delivering oxygen therapy."

However, in about 10% of cases, phaeochromocytoma is a feature of neoplastic autosomal dominant syndromes, such as Von Hippel Lindau’s disease, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) seldom associated to Von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis type I – NF1 (3-5%). The authors present the case of a 54 year-old male with a personal and family background of Von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis type I in whom a right adrenal asymptomatic mass was detected (“incidentaloma”). Further investigation disclosed a phaeochromocytoma producing high levels of epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. Despite this secretory pattern, normotension was established by 24h ambulatory pressure measurement, as well as an absence of family history of hypertension, both fairly uncommon. Some pathogenic mechanisms involved in such tumoral syndromes are debated along with their clinical manifestations, stressing the need for a systematic oncological screening in NF1 patients and family members, even if asymptomatic."

On physical examination, we detected multiple tumors on his face, scalp, back and both legs evolving for 30 years. We referred him to the Internal Medicine to evaluate his clinical condition. After the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery cooperation, it was possible to diagnose the existence of multiple cylindroma tumors. We also managed several other conditions diagnosed in the visit: arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and mixed dyslipidaemia. The authors would like to emphasize the scope and impact such disease can have on an individual’s life. Due to its aspect, he isolated himself, allowing tumors to evolve and emerging diseases remaining undiagnosed. Although it is a rare nosological entity, it can become malignant and it deserves, also for this, our special attention to the patient and the family."

In this review they point out the demographic patterns of the population, the pre-existence of co-morbidities, the previous use of antibiotics, the pneumonia clinical presentation, the cultures collected, which microbiological agents are more frequently founded, the therapeutic approach, how many days they were at the hospital and finally, the outcome.

In some cases, monoclonal gammopathies may occur as a result of abnormal B cells, which have not yet developed into plasma cells. This type of gammopathy is seen in leukaemia or lymphoma. Hypergammaglobulinemia increases serum viscosity being the most common cause of hyperviscosity syndrome. Symptoms of hyperviscosity usually appear when the normal serum viscosity of 1.4 to 1.8 cp reaches 4 to 5 cp, corresponding to a serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) level of at least 3 g/dL, IgG level of 4 g/dL, and an IgA level of 6 g/dL. Symptoms of hyperviscosity may include constitutional symptoms, bleeding and ocular, neurological or cardiovascular manifestations. Several etiologic factors have been associated with priapism. Major etiologic categories are hematologic dyscrasias, neurologic conditions, nonhematologic malignancies, trauma, erectile dysfunction pharmacotherapy, pharmacologic exposure and idiopathic factors. Long standing priapism due to malignant lymphoma is a rare incident. We report a case of lymphoma with abnormal production of serum IgM (more than 5 g/dL) and priapism as first clinical manifestation."

                    "The authors present a case of a 49-year-old man, referred to the Emergency Department with headache, palpitations, abdominal pain and nausea. He had a past medical history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and hypertension. On examination there was intense perspiration, blood pressure 240/173 mmHg and tachycardia. Laboratory findings revealed raised metanephrines in the 24-h urine specimen and imaging tests displayed a solid nodule in the left adrenal gland. Further evaluation led to the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. After appropriate pre-surgery therapy, a left adrenalectomy was performed. On follow up, 6 months after surgery, the patient was asymptomatic with good blood pressure control. The reason for presenting this case is not only its rarity since phaeochromocytoma occurs in only 1% of NF1 patients, but also to point out the need to look for specific causes of hypertension in young patients, mainly those with NF1."

                    "Background: Sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis (SLL) of the breast is a rare benign mastopathy, usually associated to diabetes mellitus type 1 or, very rarely, to other autoimmune diseases. The authors describe a patient where this condition is associated to autoimmune thyroiditis.Case report: A 32 year-old woman, with chronic migraine and no past history of diabetes or breast cancer, complaining of severe headaches, palpitations, irritability and arterial hypertension. Hyperthyroidism and diffuse goiter due to autoimmune thyroiditis were diagnosed, with positive anti-thyroperoxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. A 3 cm sub-areolar mass was noted in the right breast, diffuse, firm and slightly painful, with no lymph node enlargement. Several fine-needle aspiration cytologies were negative for malignant cells; core biopsy showed periductal, vascular and lobular phenotypically normal lymphocytic infiltration with severe stromal fibrosclerosis. The patient was prescribed thiamazole withdrawn after progression for hypothyroidism. Attempt to treat the SLL with oral corticoid therapy was not successful. About 1.5 years after the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis, mastopathy remains stable with few symptoms without specific treatment.Discussion: The etiology of breast LLE is unknown, but its strong association with autoimmune diseases and increased expression of HLA-DR in affected epithelial cells suggests that an immune reaction to components of the mammary stroma can lead to fibro-inflammatory changes. To date, there is no evidence of neoplastic potential although data are scarce. It is unknown whether treatment of the underlying autoimmune disease may influence the natural history of this disease. In the absence of targeted therapy, watchful waiting seems to be the most appropriate"

Furthermore, the patient mentioned impaired coordination of voluntary movements for the last year, with an acute confusional episode about 2 months earlier. Regarding her personal history she was a smoker, light alcohol habits, light tricuspid insufficiency and had been submitted to hysterectomy for cervical dysplasia. There was a history of recent right acute otitis media, as well as a homolateral dental abscess.On physical examination, there was right palpebral ptosis, light anisocoria, binocular diplopia, abolished right direct and consensual photomotor reflexes, adiadochokinesis and light dysmetria at the finger-nose test, particularly with the left superior extremity.As the head CT scan was normal, the patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department in order to clarify the clinical frame.On the 3rd day of admission, she mentioned worsening of the headache, another CE CT-scan was carried out, with intravenous contrast showing subarachnoid hemorrhage. 3D reconstruction displayed an aneurysm on the right posterior communicating artery.The authors discuss the diagnostic approach used in this particular case, as well as the correct approach (according to literature) in a situation of third cranial nerve paresis."

                    "Background: to provide a quality service is crucial to understand the need for change. A different approach of those procedures and results implies an involvement and a motivation of Health Care professionals. The performance of a Health Service is nowadays linked to the level of access and organization of the clinical information. In such context, a correct and complete documentation of the patient’s clinical data is essential for the practice of a quality Medical care, being the clinical record the basis of a hospital management and structure.Aim: the endpoint of this work was to compare 2004 and 2005 regarding the quality criteria of medical records, proposed with predefined variables, to determine the rate of achievement.Material and Methods: a descriptive and transverse observation study based on the medical record of each patient, referring to the year 2004 and to the year 2005. The predefined variables were the existence of a classic clinical history, the ward admission notice, the hospital discharge notice, the patient’s problems list, based on Weed’s method and the record of laboratorial analysis on a specific registration sheet. The reasons why the hospitalization was extended where also assessed not only measuring it but also identifying the causes of such delay. There were a total of 1031 (F554; M507) patients admitted in 2004 with a mean age was 70 years [15-103] and the average hospitalization period was 7,6 days [1-78]. In the year of 2005 there were a total of 1030 (F531; M499) patients admitted, with a mean age of 71 years [16-99] and the average hospitalization period was 8 days [1-101].Results: In both years, 2004 and 2005, the admission notice was recorded in 100% of patients, excluding the cases where the Clinical History was recorded. With exception of patients deceased and transferred to other services, the Discharge Notice was also complied with in 100% of cases. The classical clinical history was made in 213 patients (21%) in 2004 and in 87 patients (8.5%) in 2005. The laboratory analysis sheet and the Weed’s list were recorded in 866 (84%) and 847 patients (82%) in 2004 and in 898 (87%) and 863 patients (84%) in 2005, respectively. The extended hospitalization was verified in 11% and 9% of the patients (2004 and 2005), respectively; the social problems were the major causes in the first year and the clinical problems in the second.Conclusion: regarding the clinical record we consider very positive the results achieved. However it is a reason for concern the limited number of Clinical Histories recorded, as well as its reduction when compared to 2004. On the extended hospitalization on Medicine 1 ward, the clinical issues are as important as the social ones. We also find that the implementation of structured assessment forms impact the clinical practice promoting a higher standard quality"

However, some NHL emerge from different places other than the lymph nodes or spleen and are referred to as primary extranodal lymphoma (PE-NHL). The purpose of this study is to illustrate the clinicopathological features of patients presenting PE-NHL.Among 125 patients studied with NHL, 37 cases (30%) were PE-NHL. The ratio men/women was 1:1, with a mean age of 61 years old. There were 8 lymphomas (20%) of T-phenotype and 29 (80%) of B-phenotype. Skin and gastrointestinal tract were the most common sites, 32.4% and 29.7% respectively; 24% had B symptoms; 81% were localized (stage IE or IIE). Histologically (WHO classification), 3% of all cases had high aggressive features (Burkitt lymphoma), 68% aggressive and 29% indolent. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounted for 51% and MALT lymphoma for 14% of all cases. According to International Prognostic Index (IPI), 7% of our patients were in the high risk group, 3% in the intermediate high, 20% in the intermediate low and 70% in the low risk group.In conclusion, PE-NHL is a heterogeneous group of diseases, most of them localized in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. We found a higher percentage of T phenotype cases than those for nodal NHL. DLBCL was the most frequent histological subtype lymphoma. IPI was predictive of survival, but its use is uncertain on PE-NHL, because it can not stratify patients homogeneously"

                    "Brucellosis is an endemic zoonosis in Portugal, progressing as a multisystemic disease with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, that can be caused by several species of Brucella, the most common being B. melitensis. Hematological abnormalities, including anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, may be found during the course of the disease.The authors describe the case of a 53 year-old man, native of Cape Verde and residing in Portugal for 25 years, with a condition of prolonged fever and had a dramatic evolution, with septic shock, severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic dyscrasia. The disease was diagnosed as acute brucellosis, and confirmed through blood cultures. Despite the severity of the clinical situation, the prompt institution of hemodynamic support, blood transfusion, invasive ventilation and appropriate antibiotics led to a satisfactory clinical outcome. The diagnosis of brucellosis can be delayed, particularly when only less common manifestations are present. In this case it was our purpose to highlight the importance of maintaining a high degree of suspicion in order to correctly diagnose cases with less familiar clinical presentations"

The authors report a clinical case of a 52 year-old man, with a prior medical history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with a detected high blood pressure only in the right arm in a medical appointment. We studied the different vascular territories which are more frequently affected by the atherosclerotic disease, it was diagnosed left subclavian artery stenosis (related with the observed subclavian steal phenomenon), bilateral carotid occlusion, bilateral aorto-iliac lesions and left popliteal artery occlusion. The authors would like to emphasize the fact that despite the extension of the atherosclerotic disease, the patient had never had an acute vascular event, until now. They want also to emphasize the relevance of adequate and careful medical history and physical examination. That is why the internal medicine doctors must have a permanent alert attitude and consequently an active role in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases."

The diagnosis is based on the presence of at least 2 of 7 criteria established on the National Institute of Health Consensus Conference of Bethesda in 1987.Although in adults the diagnosis is rather easy, when it comes to children the café-au-lait spots may be, for a long period of time the only sign, keeping the disease undiagnosed.Besides the typical café-au-lait and neurofibromas there is an aggravated risk of developing malignant neoplasms, namely malignant peripheral nerve sheaths tumors also referred to as schwannomas or neurofibrosarcomas.These neurofibrosarcomas have a smaller response to the conventional cancer treatment, and it is believed that many genetic factors are responsible for their higher aggressiveness.Malignant tumors are the main cause of death by NF1, being associated to mortality at tender age. The case we describe is such an example."

The aim of this work is to be an observational study, in order to see how we treat and how we care for our terminal patients, including cancer patients, as well as other chronic diseases as dementia, heart failure, HIV/AIDS and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A retrospective analysis of 286 clinical files of deceased patients, in a 16 month period, in a Lisbon hospital was made. The epidemiologic characterization was, as expected, an old and dependent population, with a major presence of cardiovascular diseases followed by respiratory diseases. Regarding the population, 73% of deaths were expected, but just 44% were considered to be in palliative care. Pain was evaluated predominantly in cancer patients, being treated in 77% of cases. The decision of palliative care was discussed with the family in 26% of patients, but it was not discussed with the patient him/herself. Education in this area is necessary in order to make a systematic intervention with terminal patients. A definition of patients’ expectations and systematic pain research in all terminal patients is needed to improve quality of end-of-life care."

Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis has been described in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, intestinal obstruction, collagen vascular diseases, systemic amyloidosis, infectious colitis, intestinal ischemia and infarction, Crohn’s disease and iatrogenic conditions (drugs, surgery and endoscopy). Most commonly reported presentations include abdominal pain, subacute intestinal obstruction, diarrhea and bloody stools. Nevertheless, it is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally during investigation of unrelated symptoms.Nonoperative management should be pursued in most patients, consisting in oxygen therapy, namely hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Surgery should be considered for patients who develop complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, peritonitis and severe hemorrhage. The authors report a case of pneumatosis intestinalis associated with diabetes pharmacological treatment with acarbose."

Thus, the occurrence of hydatid disease is analyzed at several levels: Country, Great Regions, Alentejo, Evora district, and the counties of this district.The final conclusion is that the majority of the Country is, in general, sine endemic in human hydatid disease, the only occurrences being sporadic cases that are, more often than not, the result of old infections. As far as the Alentejo is concerned – in the past the largest endemic region of Portugal – there are counties in the districts of Portalegre and Beja that are sine endemic, and some hypo-endemic; only the district of Évora has a few counties that are meso-endemic and only one that is hyper-endemic."

                    "Nailfold capillary microscopy (NCM) is an easy and non-invasive exam that allows the observation of capillaries.Raynaud’s Phenomenon (RP) can be the manifestation of an underlying systemic illness so, it would be useful to have an easy exam making it simpler to distinguish primary from secondary.The aims of this study were: to evaluate which capillaroscopic changes are more frequent in RP; to analyse the informative value of the different criteria and determine the validity of NCM for the diagnosis of RP.The clinical files of patients observed by NCM due to RP were evaluated. According to capillaroscopic criteria they were classified in three groups: primary RP, secondary RP due to a probable Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) and secondary RP to Systemic Sclerosis (SS).According to the final clinical diagnosis made in later consultations (medium follow-up 2,3 years), patients were also placed into three groups (primary RP, DCT and SS). The sample comprised 286 individuals: 40 with SS pattern, 111 with probable CTD and 135 with primary RP.Differences of the alterations among the 3 groups were very significant. In primary RP we observed more stasis (38,5%), and edema (35,6%), in CTD, serious dystrophies (89,2%) and in SS edema and blurred capillary outlines in all patients. Tests for sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were high as well as statistical index among the various pathologies (Cohen K = 0.87).We concluded that NCM criteria are an important help to differentiate the etiology of RF. The high sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and statistical agreement levels make it possible to recommend NCM as the first step exam for the evaluation of patients with RP."

Osteoporosis diagnosis is made on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The major complications are fractures. The prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are aimed at reducing substantially the fractures. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may slow the rate of bone loss or mildly increase BMD. Bisphosphonates are currently the most used drugs, they reduce osteoclast activity and are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. Strontium ranelate is an alternative to bisphosphonates. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, prevents bone loss, like estrogen, but probably without prejudicial side effects of estrogen. Estrogen alone, or in combination with progesteron, is now seldom used. Calcitonin, a peptide produced by thyroid C cells, inhibits bone resorption, but its clinical efficacy is moderate. Teriparatide, a parathyroid hormone analogue, is an potent bone anabolic agent that increases bone formation; however, this medication is reserved for severe cases. Balanced nutrition with adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, physical activity and loadbearing exercise seem to be effective in maintaining or increasing BMD. Also, it is necessary to instruct the patients, concerning the prevention of osteoporotic fractures."

                    "The cell-based therapy is being envisaged as a potential strategy for myocardial repair in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart failure. The present phase of knowledge allows us to expect the use of skeletal myoblasts or autologous stem cells to become safe, feasible and effective. Available data suggest the benefit of the use of myoblasts in cardiac function with improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction, decreasing of end diastolic and end systolic volumes.Increasing of the contractility of the ischaemic area, diminishing of the functional NYHA class and decreasing of the new cases of revascularization and hospitalizations are envisaged. Nevertheless the mechanisms by which these cells provide repair are still unknown. However the cell differentiation into myocites, the promotion of angiogenesis, paracrine factors secretion which increase the function of the surviving myocites, inhibition of cell matrix destruction and of the apoptosis of cardiomyocites and fusion between transplanted cells and resident cells have been proposed as possible explanations.We must underline that neither the best locus to collect stem cells or the best way of their management is cleared up.There are also some issues related to technical difficulties and emerging complications that are still not solved. Hopefully undergoing research will enlighten most of our doubts and will allow us to reach conclusions."

One of these means is to register oncological cases.The main objective of this work is to observe the evolution of oncological disease in a main hospital.Data were collected from cases of primary malignant tumours diagnosed de novo or treated and which had been registered on the database of the hospital’s Cancer Registry over a period of 7 years, between 2000 and 2006.Over the last 4 years there has been a gradual increase in new cases in general and in the hospital.The most commonly affected areas were the skin (more than 80% were squamous and basocellular carcinomas), followed by the prostate and the breast. Cancer of the colon and rectum together, were the most frequent. There was a significant increase in lung cancer, especially in men.With the exception of breast cancer, all forms of cancer were diagnosed at an earlier age. All cases of malignant neoplasms were more frequent in men.Lastly, we can state that these data are a useful contribution to the general picture of the oncological situation of the hospital. In this group of population, cancer of the breast, prostate and of the intestine continue to be those that require our attention the most. In order to understand better oncological disease in a hospital and to assess the care given it is fundamental to have a reliable hospital oncology register which can describe well the disease and can enable its follow-up."

The average of occurrence is in persons 40 to 50 years old. The most common symptoms are due to the effect of the hypoglycaemia on the central nervous system.Insulinomas are generally small (≥90% are ≤2 cm), usually not multiple (90%), and only 5 to 15% are malignant. They almost invariably occur only in the pancreas, distributed equally in the pancreatic head, body and tail.Diagnosis relies on clinical features along with laboratory tests and imaging investigations to aid in localization. We report a case of a 57 year old man, who had since his 50 years, episodes of neuroglycopenia, which manifested by dizziness, sweating, headache and confusion. A 72 h fast test, serum levels of insulin and C-peptide strongly suggested insulinoma.Preoperative tumour localization was achieved by means of MRI and selective angiography that revealed a 2 cm nodule in the tail of the pancreas; ultrasonography (US), computed tomography and Octreoscan were not helpful.Surgical resection was performed and splenic vein blood sample showed insulin levels of 5410 mcUI/ml and 186 mcUI/ml respectively, before and after tumour extraction.Histopathology was consistent with the diagnosis of benign Insulinoma.There was a favourable clinical evolution, with complete normalization of the clinical symptoms and laboratory."

This revision aims to explain the antithrombotic options to take in patients with cardio embolic pathogenesis. The methodology used in the process of revision was a detailed analysis of a set of articles obtained by inquiry Medline and Google, clinic trails and revisions, including the last 15 years of investigation in the stroke area. In spite of being difficult to establish the pathogenesis of an ischemic cerebral infarction, his determination is of extreme importance once that it is determinative of the therapeutic direction. The more frequent embolic focus is the heart and the first step in the determination of the potential pathogenesis is the recognition of the embolic potential of the cardiopathy. Atrial fibrillation is the more frequent major risk cardiopathy. In primary prevention, patients with one or more high risk factors must be treated with oral anticoagulant and patients with low risk must be treated by anti-platelets drugs. In patients with moderated risk the therapeutic choice depends on the preferences of the patient, the individual haemorrhagic risk and the possibility of the efficiently control of the anticoagulant therapy. On secondary prevention the decision must be based in the most probable cause of cerebral infarction, so the subtype of cerebral infarction has an important role in the choice of the secondary preventive therapy."

Several guidelines exist on the appropriate use of TM, however they are frequently overused. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of informative and audit activities about the correct use of TM on the use of TM in an internal medicine department in a baseline and in a post interventional evaluation.Results: At baseline TM were requested in 19,6% of patients whereas after the intervention this figure dropped 42,6% to 10,2%. In the baseline study the main reason for TM request was diagnosis while in the post-interventional study it screening. In both studies the majority of appropriate requests were done for screening. In both studies most of inappropriate requests were done for diagnosis. In the baseline study 17, 5% of the requests were considered appropriate and there were an increase of appropriateness (TM appropriated in the post-interventional study: 46%). There was an important decrease in the total costs related to TM, mainly due to a decrease in the costs of inappropriate requests.Discussion: The present study shows that informative and “self-audit “activities can have a positive impact in the clinical practice, with a decreased in costs."

In order to characterize PU bearing patients in an Internal Medicine ward, a retrospective and descriptive analysis of the clinical records of all patients admitted in Coimbra University Hospital - Medicine 1 ward during a 6 months period (between January and June 2006) was done, regarding several individual criteriae including age, sex, home conditions, major admission diagnosis, duration of hospital stay, mobility status, co-morbilities, mortality and number, location and severity of pressure ulcers.The results showed that patients reported as PU bearers when discharged represent a small fraction of the real PU patients count. Most PU bearing patients were over 65 years old. An important association was found between PU and cronic neuropathy with sensitive, motor or cognitive deficits (p<0,001), such as cerebral vascular accident, and also institutionalization in retirement homes (p<0,001). The majority of PU were sacrococcigeal. Fifty per cent of the new PU detected in the ward arised in patients who already presented PU in admission. The presence of PU determined a longer duration of hospital stay (p<0,001) and a higher mortality rate (p<0,001) of the affected patients."

In the first case, only the high degree of suspicion and the decision of starting tuberculosis therapy leading to the resolution of the patient’s complaints, allowed us to make the diagnosis. In the second case, the diagnosis was only confirmed with the study of the material obtained by aspiration, with Löwenstein method. The rib tuberculosis is a rare infectious disease with a difficult diagnosis, which is based on the high degree of suspicion, on tuberculosis endemicity and the existence of possible imunodepressor commorbilities"

An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed 6 polyps in the upper body of the stomach. All polyps were diagnosed as carcinoid using endoscopic biopsies. After exclusion of metastasis (by CT scan and Octreotid scan), and taking into account the multifocal involvement of the tumor and the presence of complete intestinal metaplasia in the gastric body, the patient was proposed for total gastrectomy held without complications. It is under treatment with vitamin B-12, with excellent clinical and analytical response. The presentation of this case alerts to the risk of the appearance of gastric carcinoid tumors in patients with PA and the need for upper endoscopy immediately after the diagnosis of the same. In gastric carcinoids type I, with no metastasis, the trend is benign."

                    "Background: In-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) has a severe prognosis, but is usually preceded by alert signs. These signs should be recognized and necessary procedures predicted. Methods: Retrospective evaluation of alert signs and symptoms in the 6 hours before death, decision of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) and attitudes chosen in deceased patients in a 3 year period. Results: Four hundred and three patient files were reviewed (mortality rate 11,4%). Mortality was homogeneously distributed in respect to week day and time. Alert signs and symptoms in the 6 hours before death were identified in 291 patients (72,2%), specially: depressed level of consciousness (129 patients), desaturation (104) and dyspnoea (92). Doctors were called in 133 cases and their attitudes were: reversion in 70 patients, relieving in 67, no attitude at all in 60 and assuming DNR in 40. The DNR was present in 348 patients (86,4%) and registered in 92,0%. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted in 2 patients (0,5%) with explicit DNR and in 1 (0,2%) with implicit DNR. CPR was not attempted in 35 patients (8,7%), although there was no recorded indication in the patient file for DNR.Conclusions: Alert signs and symptoms preceded most CRA, allowing an opportunity for intervention. Mostly nurses identified these signs. The indication for DNR was recorded in the files of most patients. The low number of patients with indication for CPR is a surrogate of patient’s complexity. This study reinforces the need for intervention in recognition, evaluation and decision in the pre-arrest patients."

                    "Context: Tuberculosis (Tb) is the 2nd death cause from infectious disease in the world. Portugal is a high incidence country. In the majority of Hospitals in Portugal, Tb patients are initialy admitted to Internal Medicine wards. In the absence of isolation rooms with negative pressure, there are recommendations for other attitudes that minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of Tb.Objectives: To evaluate the risk-control attitudes that were taken facing hospitalized Tb patients in an Internal Medicine ward of a general Hospital; to quantify the time of permanence of potencially infectious patients in the ward.Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the hospitalized patients with Tb at an Internal Medicine ward with 33 beds, during the period of 3 years. Inclusion criteria: previous Tb diagnosis with less than 4 weeks of treatment; diagnosis during the hospitalization, with treatment decision; microbiological diagnosis after withdrawal from the ward. Evaluated attitudes: “separation” (curtains, increasing bed intervals); use of mask; high efficiency particle aspirator; transference to other institution.Results: In a total of 2810 admissions, 39 cases of Tb were included (1,4%), 25 of them with pulmonary forms of disease. Sixteen of these were high risk transmitters, with positive direct or cultural microbiological identification in respiratory secretions. The hospitalizations of these patients completed 303 days (162 until the diagnosis and 141 after the diagnosis), most of them (169 days) without risk-control attitudes. Among the 141 days after the diagnosis, only in 7 were risk-control attitudes not taken. Risk-control attitudes were taken in 14 patients, all of them with pulmonary Tb. The 2 remaining patients only had cultural diagnosis, after withdrawal from the ward.Discussion and conclusions: In 14 of the 16 infectious patients, the recommended risk-control attitudes were taken, after the diagnosis. Despite this acceptable accomplishement, there were 169 hospitalization days with risk of transmission, wich we can relate to late suspicion and/or diagnosis. It is necessary to reduce the treshold for suspicion and risk-control attitudes. The authors present some proposals that might reduce the nosocomial exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis."

                    "Cryptococcus is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. This article retrospectively describes the number of HIV patients at S. Marcos Hospital diagnosed with Criptococcal meningitis, between January 1998 and July 2004. During this 66 month period 18 cases have been identified. In our series there was no correlation between the stage of the HIV infection and the clinical manifestations at the time of admission. Given that no association was found between the initial clinical manifestations and opening pressure in the initial lumbar puncture, the former can not be taken as a trustworthy indicator of the need to lighten the intracranial pressure. Our work re-emphasises the importance of evaluating the opening pressure, as a means to diagnose intracranial hypertension. The drainage of liquor, eventually backed by appropriate neurosurgical techniques, is an adequate alternative method to alleviate intracranial hypertension, when strong evidence supporting the use of medication for that purpose is scarce. The reduction of mortality and morbidity relies on an aggressive approach, which combines the use of anti-fungal therapy with external drainage, or even peritoneal shunting."

                    "Sjögren Syndrome is considered an autoimmune disease of the exocrine glands, which involves especially the salivary and lachrymal glands. The clinical manifestations are wide, and can only be clearly shown by dryness of the oral and conjunctival mucosa or by articular, lung and/or renal involvement.One third of the patients with this syndrome present with systemic manifestations, which include the B cells lymphoma, namely the MALT lymphoma of the Sjögren’ target-organs. In spite of its scarcity and its slow course, the patients have a worst prognosis in relation to the other type of MALT lymphoma, due to its tendency to dissemination and to the inherent therapeutic implications.A case of a 64 years old male patient coming from the Oncology consultation is reported, with MALT lymphoma initial diagnosis, shown after the right parotid gland excision which was due to recurrent parotiditis episodes. Once the patient presented oral and conjunctival dryness complaints, SS-A(Ro) e SS-B(La) autoantigens were determined and Schirmer’s I test was performed, and their positivities confirm the Primary Sjögren Syndrome diagnosis.Due to xerostomia and MALT lymphoma coexistence, chemotherapy treatment with CHOP protocol was chosen.The scarcity and singularity of this case study have led the authors to its publication."

The steroids side-effects and the inefficiency of azathioprine as “steroid sparing agent” contribute to the difficulty in monitoring the progression of the disease.Given the unfavourable progression of sarcoidosis and the desire expressed by the patient to become pregnant, we present this case as a model of the challenges posed by this disease."

                    "Sjögren Syndrome (SS) is an auto-immune disorder with a high incidence and prevalence, variable clinical manifestations and well-defined diagnostic criteria. Increasing attention has been devoted to areas like its pathological mechanisms and the search for new therapeutic strategies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is indicated for many disorders, and investigation on its mechanisms of action has yielded some preliminary findings, especially on its effects on the immune activity. The spectrum for its therapeutic use, although very controversial, has been increasing, mainly in situations involving auto-immune processes. There are a few written cases on the use of IVIg in the SS’s treatment, especially when neurological manifestations occur. In this paper we review the interest of using IVIg in SS, and analyze the published case reports of its use. We find that IVIg seems an important therapeutic option for many cases of SS. Accumulating data suggests a rational for its use as second line option in cases of extraglandular manifestations resistant to conventional treatment."

This evaluation was followed up to 15 years (1992-2006). The objective of this work is to evaluate the main clinical findings that suggest IgA-D and describe the complications observed.The clinical manifestations in patients whit IgA-D were recurrent infections (31.7%), autoimmune diseases (25.6%), allergies (24.3%), haematological diseases (6.9%), endocrinological diseases (4.87%) and oncological diseases (7.3%). The respiratory system was the most affected by infections; systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis were the most frequent autoimmune diseases; eczema and rhinitis were the most frequent allergic symptoms; gastric and colon adenocarcinoma were the most frequent oncological diseases. Other disorders include Hashimoto´s thyroiditis, Diabetes Mellitus type 1, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, pernicious anemia and anaphylactic reaction blood products.IgA-D has a large clinical spectrum and early diagnosis would indicate prophylaxis in patients whit recurrent infections, autoimmune diseases and allergies. Patients with SIgA are at risk of developing a severe anaphylactic reaction upon receiving IgA-containing blood and blood products"

Recent climatic changes may allow propagation of its mosquito vector in Europe, raising concern about the propagation of this and other diseases among us.Authors report a case of a patient which was admitted for fever after returning from Brazil and in whom Dengue fever was diagnosed, and review the history of this infection in Europe and several aspects concerning epidemiology, clinics, diagnostic, therapeutics and prevention of Dengue fever."

They have a high morbidity and are not infrequently the first sign of an associated malignancy and they may be a part of another connective tissue disease.The treatment of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is challenging for a number of reasons – patient heterogeneity, limited clinical trial data and suboptimal assessment tools to quantitate disease activity and damage and reliably distinguish between them. Despite these limitations and challenges, and after confirming the diagnosis, determining the clinical and serologic subgroup of the patient, assessing extramuscular manifestations and defining the relative contribution of disease activity and damage to the patient’s condition, a therapeutic plan should be developed and followed. Although corticosteroids remain the mainstay of an initial treatment plan, combination immunosuppressive regimens and other novel disease-modifying immunologic agents are new additions to the therapeutic arsenal of inflammatory myopathy. Rehabilitative measures and physical therapy interventions are critical elements to include at every stage in the treatment plan.The authors present two cases of Dermatomyositis, illustrate some of the complexities in the presentation and natural history of these disease and the benefits of intensive therapy."

Antiretroviral therapy costs were estimated according to the values provided by the Hospital Pharmacy and assuming its monthly dispense.Results: During 2002, 107 patients were observed, in a total of 498 consultations (€11.424). Viral load was assessed 244 times (€24.321) and CD4 studies 245 times (€15.445). Other blood tests totalled €36.586. Eighty-five of the 107 patients were on antiretroviral therapy, with an average expense per patient of €7.122. Eighteen patients had to be admitted in the Hospital, for a total of 219 days (€41.699). Conclusion: The yearly average cost per patient was €6.408."

These symptoms persisted after delivery and weight loss become worse (about 20%). Hypotension was also noticed by this time. Laboratory tests showed hyponatremia and hypocloremia, very high plasma ACTH levels and very low levels of plasma cortisol and plasma aldosterona. Other hormonal plasma levels were within normal range. The computerized tomographies of the adrenals and of the pituitary gland were also normal. The autoantibodies study revealed positive anti-thyroid antibodies. Diabetes mellitus wasn’t present.

                    "INTRODUCTION: Systemic sclerosis (SSc), an immunologic disorder of unknown aetiology, is characterized by progressive tissue fibrosis, localized or diffuse.The diffuse sub-type and prolonged course of the disease are associated with increased risk of visceral involvement, mainly of the lungs and kidneys. Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) are not mutually exclusive, but they are rarely associated; however, both are important causes of death in these patients. Mortality in SS is four times that of the general population; mainly in the first 3-5 years, the overall survival rate at 15 years is around 50%. We report a case of this rare association and present a brief review of pathophysiology and therapeutics. CASE REPORT: A 56 year-old female, caucasian, SSc diagnosed 3,5 years before, treated with vasodilators, oral anticoagulation (due to recurrent deep venous thrombosis) and corticosteroids (she had fibrosing alveolitis, and was previously treated with 13 pulses of cyclofosfamide with a favourable response).She was admitted with fever, arterial hypertension, periorbital oedema and worsening renal function. A bilateral pleural effusion was diagnosed, without alveolitis, it was a transudate. ANA e anti-Scl-70 were positive, ANCA and antiphospholipid being negative. The echocardiogram disclosed PHT and a pericardial effusion without haemodynamic compromise. Ultrasound of the kidneys was normal. Oedema and blood pressure improved on captopril; however renal function rapidly worsened with oliguria, so a renal biopsy (RB) was made and she began hemodialysis due to uremia and fluid overload. RB histology was typical of SRC. Renal function had no improvement under dialysis. In the 29th day of hospitalization she had typical signs of pulmonary embolism, and treatment began with IV heparin; latter a cardiorespiratory arrest with assystole ensued, that didn’t responded to cardiopulmonary ressuscitation. DISCUSSION: SRC is more frequently associated with diffuse SSc and anti-Scl-70. Its hallmark is an abrupt onset of severe arterial hypertension and rapidly progressive renal failure with hiperreninemia. It may coexist a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia similar to hemolyticuremic syndrome. Therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improved survival and prognosis, reducing the necessity of dialysis, and sometimes allowing suspension of renal replacement therapy. Overlap syndrome / renal vasculitis was considered a possibility due to poliserositis and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Corticosteroid theraphy is likely associated with onset of SRC. There have been reports linking SRC with the onset of PHT in SSc. Some authors consider there is a common pathophysiology, namely the coexistence of renal and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy with myocardial dysfunction."

Study of renal failure revealed pauci-imune necrotizing nephropathy with positive anti-proteinase 3 ANCA (PR3-ANCAs) establishing the diagnosis of Wegener’s Granulomatosis. He began treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide (CFA), being released from hospital clinically improved. Ten days after discharge, he was readmitted to hospital because of a hyperglicemic hyperosmolar state. Even with dose reduction of steroids and CFA, long term therapy with insulin in order to obtain glicemic control was needed. Such presentation of diabetes mellitus as hyperglicemic hyperosmolar state within few days after beginning therapy with steroids in a previously normoglicemic patient is rare. We believe that CFA had an important role in this patient with propensity to auto-immunity phenomena. Similar to what happens in rats and already shown also in humans, CFA might have selected a clone of auto-reactive T-cells that promoted the auto-immune destruction of β-pancreatic cells."

The serological findings were anticardiolipin antibodies positive in 27 patients (93%), anti-ß2-glicopretein 1 antibodies in 25 (86%) and lupus anticoagulant in 22 (76%). The main manifestations included acute myocardial infarction in two patients, pulmonary thromboembolism in two, one patient with mesenteric thrombosis, one with venous sinus thrombosis, 10 had 21 foetal losses (86% occurred during the second and third trimester) and 13 had deep vein thrombosis. Other clinical manifestations were thrombocytopaenia in six patients, livedo reticularis in four, anaemia in three, migraine in three and one with transient cerebral ischaemia. Four female patients had successful term pregnancies. Three patients had recurrent thrombosis (two with deep vein thrombosis and one pulmonary thromboembolism) despite anticoagulant treatment. The most frequent initial antiphospholipid syndrome manifestations were deep vein thrombosis (44.8%) and pregnancy loss (34.5%). During the 29 months follow-up (3-29 months, mean 14 months) no patients developed Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune disease."

Methods: One hundred and fifty patients older than 65 years were studied, 88 males and 62 females, using the Mini-Mental State Examination.Results: The number of male patients was higher than female patients (57.5% vs 42.5%). We found an elevated average age with 56.6% of patients in the 8th decade of life and 23.3% of patients older than 80 years. Sixty one percent of patients were illiterate. We detected a low or very low score correlated with the presence of dementia in 44% of patients included in this study. This incidence was higher in female (51.6%) than male patients (40.9%).Conclusions: This study shows that most patients admitted in an internal medicine department are illiterate, elderly, with loss of cognitive function and completely dependent. Dementia is a serious problem of public health and economic issues of modern societies."

                    "The suspicion of insulinoma in an individual with adrenergic symptoms and / or neuroglycopenia must be the first concern in the differential diagnosis of hypoglycaemia. Insulinoma is the most frequent endocrine tumour of the pancreas and appears at any age, being more frequent between 40 and 60 years. The diagnosis is clinical and it can be difficult to make in the presence of doubtful symptoms of neuroglycopenia or adrenergic symptoms after meals. Whipple’s triad of - glycaemia below 50 mg/dl and symptoms / signs of hypoglycaemia that revert with administration of glucose - is strongly suggestive of insulinoma, and when associated with blood insulin inappropriately high, is diagnostic of insulinoma. The authors describe the case of a 58-year-old male patient, with a clinical picture characterized by multiple episodes of confusion, migraine, bewilderment, irritability, agitation and diaphoresis, of nearly 8 months duration. The complaints were not properly evaluated initially and the patient was treated with sedative drugs. A fasting glycaemia of 38 mg/dl made insulinoma a probable diagnosis, and this was confirmed by the 72 hour fast test. Difficulties arose, as usual, in locating the tumour with imaging methods (ultrasound, tomography scan, octreotide scan and endoscopic ultrasound) and only selective arteriography with catheterization of the branches of the coeliac artery revealed the tumour, located in the head of the pancreas. Surgical treatment consisted of tumour enucleation. The histological findings confirmed the diagnosis of benign insulinoma. The peculiarities of the diagnosis and particularities of the image studies in insulinoma are discussed."

Although human colonization is frequent, disease due to tissue invasion is uncommon and occurs primarily in the setting of immuno-suppression. In the majority of cases the prognosis is bad, given the epidemiological characteristics of the affected population and the pathogenesis of this fungus. Early diagnosis and management is therefore essential to control infection and has repercussions on the prognosis."

                    "Phaeochromocytomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours with a highly variable clinical presentation, most commonly presenting with episodes of headaches, sweating, palpitations and hypertension. The serious and potentially lethal cardiovascular complications of these tumours are due to the potent effects of secreted catecholamines. Biochemical testing for phaechromocytoma is indicated, not only in symptomatic patients, but also in patients with adrenal incidentalomas or identified genetic predispositions (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1). The authors report three cases in which a biochemical diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma was made: the first refers to a 30 year-old man admitted for investigation of a right adrenal 6cm diameter incidentaloma; the second is a 35 year-old woman studied for secondary hypertension and the third a 59 year-old woman, otherwise healthy, with a right supra-renal node on a routine ultrasound exam. Imaging techniques such as CT, MRI and functional ligands such as I123-MIBG were used to localize the biochemically proven tumour.After the use of appropriate preoperative treatment to block the effects of secreted cathecolamines, laparoscopic tumour removal was the preferred procedure. Prognosis is excellent."

The most common illness presenting as pulmonary-renal syndrome is systemic vasculitis. Wegener´s granulomatosis, microscopis polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome are described as small vessel vasculitides strongly associated with ANCA. The diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis is made on the basis of clinical findings, by biopsy of a relevant involved organ and the presence of ANCA. However, the application of ANCA testing as a clinical diagnostic tool is still regarded as controversial. Accurate understanding of the key pathogenic points of ANCA-associated vasculitis can undoubtedly provide a more rational therapeutic approach."

We also proceeded, to research the National Portuguese journals, textbooks and scientific meetings about coeliac disease."

Since the integration of this Unit in the National Health Service, it functions to help relieve congested hospital emergency services. The identification and evaluation of the unit productivity using the computer science application “sonho”, shows that in the year 2006, 36715 emergency episodes were documented, 11.2% of the patients were transferred and a mortality of one per thousand consultations was documented. Greatest use of the Unit was found in the 14-45 year age group. This reflects a lack of accessibility to primary care services as well as the confidence felt by the inhabitants of Espinho. The predominance of acute medical illness in the area of internal medicine, provided on-job training opportunities for “contract” doctors, as well as better use of hospital admission and outpatient consultations. The paediatric and geriatric age group benefited most from this.The closing of Emergency Room services in the United States and Canada, and the increase of accessibility to primary care in the United Kingdom and Spain, have not contributed to control the increase in number and appropriateness of, emergency consultations. In practice there has been a constant growth resulting in the inevitable congestion of the Casualty/Emergency Room services. The predicted closure of the Espinho hospital Unit is expected to cause a work overload for the referral hospital as well as a negative economic impact on the National Health Service."

Whilst in hospital drainage of food through the pleurostomy was observed. The patient was re-admitted for investigation of an oesophago-pleural fistula. On admission he appeared healthy. Pulmonary auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds, with wheezes and crackles. He had digital clubbing. The chest x-ray showed a right lung with tuberculosis sequelae and a compensatory hyperinflated left lung. Chest CT scan showed a reduced right lung, with pulmonary collapse of the inferior lobe, bronchiectasis, fibrosis and emphysematous lesions in the left lung apex. A dilated oesophagus was seen, with fistular communication with the pleural cavity, as shown by contrast. Upper G.I. endoscopy confirmed the presence of an oesophageal fistula in the proximal portion. The patient was submitted to pleuropneumonectomy and oesophageal fistula correction."

When there is mass necrosis, these tumours may reveal themselves through a huge release of hormones. We present the case of a 42 year old female attending a Hypertension outpatient clinic because of fainting episodes and high blood pressure. She was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 18 years and was being treated for severe depression.She had no complaints until 3 months earlier when she started suffering from “hard-to-assess” episodes of fatigue, trembling, headache, blurred vision and faintness. SBP was 160-200 mmHg. She had a slow psychomotor response and reduced facial expression. She presented with inconsistently elevated urinary metanephrines and CT scan showed a 3.4 cm mass, with a necrotic center, in her left adrenal gland. Phaeochromocytoma was confirmed with an IMBG scintigraphy. She underwent laparoscopic removal of the mass and histology revealed phaeochromocytoma.Discussion: A diagnosis of Phaeochromocytoma is hard to make because of a number of factors: the rising number of incidentalomas; the technical difficulty in combining biochemical and imaging exams; numerous drug interactions with biochemical results as well as a lack of clinical suspicion when facing unusual presenting features, such as hypotension. Tumour necrosis is usually associated with devastating clinical presentations, which were not present in this patient."

Since then there have been several epidemic outbreaks, especially during the most trying times of our History: the Napoleonic Invasions, the Liberal Wars, etc. The last important epidemic typhus outbreak in Portugal took place in 1918-1919 and it affected mostly the north of the country.In this study, the author makes an historical and statistical analysis with a special focus on problematic issues of epidemic typhus outbreaks during the first half of the 20th century.The noteworthy hallmark of this research is the author’s proof that in 1918-1919, there was not only one epidemic outbreak in Portugal but three simultaneous outbreaks: epidemic typhus, pneumonic influenza and smallpox."

                    "Introduction and aims: Stroke in young adults is less frequent and has a wider variety of causes, requiring more extensive investigation. Our aim was to evaluate the demographics, stroke type, risk factors, outcome and mortality in patients younger than 60 years.Methods: Prospective study lasting 2 years (2002- 2003) of all patients aged under 60, admitted with stroke, to our department. Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage were excluded. The study protocol included history, physical examination, computed tomography (CT), ECG, transthoracic cardiac ultrasound, carotid Doppler, blood analysis for pro-clotting and atherogenic factors and a 6-month follow-up. Other studies were performed when deemed necessary. Results: We studied 58 patients, 30 women (51.7%) and 28 men (48.3%) aged 32 to 60 (mean age 51.9±6,3). The majority (77.6%) had ischaemic stroke, 20% had haemorrhagic stroke and one patient had thrombosis of the venous sinus. The main risk factors for ischaemic stroke were hypertension (66.7%) and hyperlipidemia (64.4%); and for hemorrhagic stroke hypertension (75%) and alcoholism (58.3%). The overall mortality was 13.8%. Only 43.1% of all patients recovered without sequelae.Conclusions: Besides age, the classic risk factors for atherosclerosis were the main risk factors identifiable, although alcoholism was the second risk factor for haemorrhagic stroke. The high percentage of mortality and disability associated with stroke underlines the absolute need to control these risk factors in the population."

                    "Thalidomide was commercialized in 1956 to be used as a sedative and anti-emetic drug, but was rapidly removed from the market after it had been linked to cases of severe birth defects. Nowadays the only approved FDA indications for the use of Thalidomide are in Multiple Myeloma and Erithema Nodosum Leprosum. The anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-TNF alpha effect of the drug has led to continued interest and research about Thalidomide’s immunomodulatory activities. There are several clinical studies and many case reports of Thalidomide treatment for Behçet Disease (BD), with rapid healing of the orogenital ulcers while patients are on Thalidomide but with relapse after its discontinuation. Despite possible benefits, Thalidomide is difficult to obtain, available as an investigational agent only (in most countries), carries a significant risk of neuropathy, and is generally reserved for resistant disease in patients who will not become pregnant. So, the use of Thalidomide in the management of BD is restricted to experienced physicians.We report a group of seven patients with BD with painful oral aphthae who experienced rapid (2 to 4 weeks) complete and sustained improvement with Thalidomide after a prolonged but ineffective treatment with steroids and/or colchicine. No major side-effect were experienced (somnolence in two). Three patients who relapsed after withdrawal of Thalidomide, needed maintenance therapy at a lower dose, to prevent relapse.In our group of 7 patients we confirm the benefit of Thalidomide in recurrent mucocutaneous aphthae and BD resistant to classic drugs, without major side-effects. The effectiveness of Thalidomide is present even with low dosages, but treatment must be continuous because new lesions usually appear a few weeks after the end of treatment."

In the vast majority of cases it is associated with head trauma but it can occur in non-traumatic settings (spontaneous ASDH). These cases are very rare and have been associated with cortical artery lesions, hipocoagulability and the ingestion of drugs. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs are clearly established risk factors for ASDH in traumatic as well as spontaneous cases.The authors present a case of ASDH in an in-patient who’s only identified risk factor was the administration of a prophylactic doses of enoxaparin. We reviewed the literature on the subject and present a discussion on the causes of spontaneous ASDH with a special emphasis on anticoagulant treatment as a risk factor. We did not found any references for low molecular weight heparins in prophylactic regimes, as possible cause, for this kind of event.This case reminds us that, although rare, this entity must be considered even in the absence of head trauma, as early diagnosis and intervention may prevent a negative outcome"

The authors present a case of a woman with a prosthetic valve and several months history of fever and pancytopaenia, with negative cultures and serology positive for Bartonella spp. A revision of the approach for diagnosis of the culturenegative endocarditis, specifically cases due to Bartonella sp., is reported."

The patient had lost 7kg in the same time period. The only abnormality noted on physical examination were acromegalic facies and basal rhonchus on chest auscultation. Chest x-ray showed a hypotransparent image in the right lung and important cardiomegaly. Laboratory tests showed Hb=13g/dL, Hct=41%, WBC=11200/mm3, Platelets=264000/mm3, Ur=123 mg/dL, Cr=2.5 mg/dL, Na=133 mEq/L, K=6.1 mEq/L, Ca=11 mg/dL, fast glucose=89 mg/dL, uric acid=11 mg/dL, Albumin=4.4 g/dL, AST=44 UI/mL, ALT=20 UI/mL, LDH=561 UI/mL. Antibiotics for respiratory infection were started and GH and IGF-I blood analysis for suspected acromegaly were performed. After improvement of renal function with fluid administration (Ur=47 mg/dL e Cr= 1.2 mg/dL), CT of the cranium, thorax and abdomen were performed. Cranium CT showed lesions suggestive of secondary neoplastic metastases. Thoracic CT revealed a tumoural lesion in the right bronchus. Abdominal CT showed an aortic aneurysm. The patient started radiotherapy for cerebral metastases, with improvement of neurologic manifestations. Biopsy of the pulmonary lesion revealed a non-small cell lung carcinoma and the patient started chemotherapy. The dosage of IGF-I was 482 (adjusted reference for gender and age = 64-188) and GH was 0.57 (reference= 0.06-7), compatible with acromegaly.

In 1968, Lawrence Weed proposed a record system that became known as Problem Oriented Clinical Record. This system was particularly directed to general specialties, which in the Hospital means Internal Medicine. At the Santo António General Hospital, this is the adapted record system used in Internal Medicine wards. In the present article, the authors revisit the system that was proposed by Weed and present it from a personal perspective, in light of their experience in the institution."

This phenomenon has been designated as the “incretin effect”. This effect is caused by the gastrointestinal peptides “gastric inhibitory polypeptide” (GIP) and “glucagon-like peptide-1” (GLP-1). These incretin hormones are responsible for the major part of postprandial insulin secretion. Preparations based on GLP-1 are able to reduce the incretin effect in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, oral administration of GLP-1 is inefficient as GLP-1 is destroyed in the gastrointestinal tract. Subcutaneous or intravenous bolus GLP-1 is inactivated by plasma enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-4). GLP-1 is only efficient by continuous parenteral infusion. GLP-1 analogues/derivatives or incretin mimetics exendine-4, are active after subcutaneous injection, and DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and vildagliptin, given orally, are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

The onset was fulminant in 6.9%, acute in 20.7% and insidious or chronic in 72.4%. Asthenia (65.6%), anorexia (48.3%), nausea and vomiting (48.3%), were the most common symptoms; 24.1% were asymptomatic. Applying the scoring system of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group, the diagnosis was definitive in 69% and probable in 31%. HAI type I was diagnosed in 86.2%, 3.5% were type II and in 10.3% none of the standard antibodies were found. Two pts were positive for anti-VHC, 1 for HbsAg and 1 had a recent history of hepatitis A. Initial therapy was prednisolone in 13 pts and prednisolone + azathioprine in 15. Complete response was achieved in 39.3%, partial response in 7.1%, failure in 25% and relapse in 28.6%. Four patients underwent liver transplantation. During a mean follow-up period of 69 months (range, 1 to 213 months), the mortality was 13.8%: 2 pts died from hepatic failure, 1 from sepsis and 1 from herpetic meningitis.Conclusions: At the time of diagnosis, 24.1% of the patients were asymptomatic and 27.1% had cirrhosis; therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine was more effective than prednisolone monotherapy; liver transplantation was required in 4 patients; the evolution was favourable in the majority of cases."

Diarrhoea was defined as 3 or more loose watery stools during a 24-hour period. Patients with colectomy or ileostomy were excluded. From a total of 461 patients admitted, 140 met the inclusion criteria; of these, 52 developed diarrhoea. For clinical characterisation the following parameters were evaluated: age, gender, ICU stay, severity scores (APACHE II and SAPS II), therapy with antibiotics, serum urea and creatinine, haemoglobin (Hg), serum proteins, co-morbilities and ICU mortality. Patients with and without diarrhoea were compared regarding the above parameters. Comparison was performed with student t- test; correlation between numerical variables was performed with linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictive parameters for mortality in patients with diarrhoea.Results: Patients with diarrhoea had lower Hg (p=0,007), higher serum urea (p=0,014) and higher mortality (p<0,001). Deceased patients with diarrhoea presented a lower Hg (p=0,001) and a higher serum urea (p=0,0014) and creatinine (p=0,03). Hg was independently related to mortality in patients with diarrhoea (p=0,002).Conclusions: Patients who developed diarrhoea in an ICU presented higher mortality, lower Hg, higher serum urea and more frequent cephalosporin use (p=0,02). Deceased patients with diarrhoea presented lower Hg levels and higher serum urea and creatinine. Hg was independently predictive of death in patients with diarrhoea."

The disease has several aetiologies and assumes special importance in patients with multiple risk factors. Due to the difficulty in identifying the disease, a high level of suspicion is required in order to make the diagnosis.We described the clinical case of a 33 year-old man, infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy for 6 years. The patient was partially dependent for daily living activities and was admitted for aetiological evaluation of bone pain and decreased muscular strength, progressively intensifying over the course of one year. Abnormal images were seen on a bone scan.The evidence of multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency, the presence of hypophosphatemia and imaging issues, raised the suspicion of osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency. This diagnosis was confirmed: analytically (low level of vitamin D metabolites), histologically and by therapeutic response.A brief review is made of the factors influencing vitamin D bone metabolism and their importance in maintaining a proper immunological response. It is mentioned that the absence of clinical suspicion may be responsible for many undiagnosed cases.In patients infected with HIV who present with an obscure clinical picture, we should also consider pathological entities not directly in relation to immunodeficiency, as they may be treated and have a better prognosis."

Aseptic meningitis occurs during the acute retroviral syndrome, but is rare in the chronic stage. The authors present a 44 year-old female, with HIV-1 infection diagnosed in 1994, CD4 T lymphocytes below 200/µL and an immunological response to anti-retroviral therapy. She had a hospital admission for aseptic meningitis in 2000 and recovered without treatment. In 2005 she was admitted with fever and headaches. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had 152 leucocytes/µL (97% mononuclear), proteins 2.32 g/L and glucose 0.39 g/L. Microbiologic and serologic exams were negative for Mycobacteriae, Herpesvirus, Enterovirus, Cryptococcus, Borrelia and Treponema palidum. She had CD4 T lymphocytes 590/µL and her viral load was 9764 copies/mL in serum and 9998 copies/mL in CSF. She recovered again with no treatment. A cerebral MRI showed multiple sub-cortical enhanced signal foci in the temporal and frontal lobes, which had been present since 2000, asymptomatic and with no defined aetiology. Neurological manifestations in the acute HIV-1 infection correlate with viral load in CSF, but this is unknown for the chronic stage. Association between these manifestations and elevated viral load in CSF could represent a therapeutic escape with worse neurological prognosis. Direct HIV-1 infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of mononuclear meningitides in these patients, in which case, the therapeutic strategy should consider drugs with better central nervous system (CNS) penetration."

Despite the efforts of the WHO to eradicate this disease, it has a prevalence greater than 1/10,000 in one group of fifteen countries, led by India and Brazil.Clinical features are skin lesions and sensory and/or motor peripheral neuropathy with varying presentations and impairment evolving to characteristic deformities and disability if not treated.We report two clinical cases of two females with leprosy, whose diagnosis was made in the same year and region. A lepromatous and a borderline form, each of them with particularities and diagnostic difficulties, delayed starting treatment. One had a history of residence in Brazil but the other had no contact with endemic areas or other known risks.The authors present a systematic revision of the disease, reporting the prevalence in Portugal of leprosy in the last seven years."

We describe the clinical case of a 77 year-old man, who presented with left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy for 3 months, with no other symptoms. The investigation led to the diagnosis of prostate cancer with metastatic ganglionar dissemination. Hormonal therapy induced an almost complete regression of all lymphadenopathies and a reduction of PSA from 4642 ng/dl to 0.1 ng/dl. Prostate cancer must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of supraclavicular lymphadenopathies in patients with more than 45 year-old, even in the absence of prostatic symptoms. The recent suggestion that this presentation could be more frequent than traditionally reported is discussed."

                    "In a country of gentle customs, the assassination of a King and a President of the Republic, have taken place in recent history. At the beginning of the XXth century amidst turbulent times in Europe, where political conflicts were resolved with bullets and bombs, attacks were usually perpetrated by highly charged anarchists. In this way perished Don Carlos I, and the President Sidónio Pais of Portugal, Humberto I of Italy, Jorge I of Greece, Nicolau II of Russia and paradigmatically, the Archduke Francisco Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose homicide in Sarajevo lead to the First World War.The death of a king constitutes, at all times, a phenomenon of grand social and political impact, particularly if it occurs in tragic circumstances or if it threatens to compromise the course of history, as happened in the cases of D. Sebastião and D. Carlos I. Medicine has always given great attention to royal figures and the most reputable doctors of the kingdom were summoned if an illness threatened the integrity of the monarch.During the XIXth century and fruit of the advances which characterised the evolution of knowledge, the preoccupation that clinicians had in discovering the causes of illness and death of royal figures is notorious, a process which was important for the progress in scientific methodology used. The practice of regularly embalming monarchs of the Bragança dynasty, together with the consequent necropsy study, left shrewd anatamo-clinical records of surprising accuracy.A retrospective study of illness and death in the royal family, a process accompanied by the most well-known faces of medicine at the time, offers an interesting panorama of the medical concepts of the epoch. On the 100th anniversary of regicide, which ended the life of King D.Carlos I and the Crown Prince D.Luís Filipe, precipitated the end of the monarchy in Portugal, conditioned decisively the course of national history, a small nosography of the last king of Bragança, based on an analysis of the bibliographical material available is made."

The objectives of this study were to calculate and compare the healing rate and the amputation rate for diabetic patients with chronic lower-extremity ulcers not healed after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and for diabetic patients with chronic lower-limb ulcers not treated with HBOT.Research design and methods: 66 diabetic patients with chronic lower-extremity ulcers, Wagner grades II-IV, not healed despite full standard treatment were included. 34 patients received HBOT (HBOT group). 15 did not improve (HBOT failure group) and 19 improved with this adjunctive therapy (HBOT improved group). 32 patients did not receive HBOT (control group). HBOT consisted of pure oxygen inhalation, during 90 minutes, through a facial mask in a semi-closed circuit, inside a multi-place chamber pressurized with air at 2.5 absolute atmospheres, once a day, 5 days a week. Average of 54 individual HBOT sessions.The study was carried out over a mean 55 month period for the control group, and over a mean 45 month period for the HBOT group, HBOT failure group and HBOT improved group. The patients were assessed for wound healing and need for amputation.Results: The need for amputation was significantly less in the HBOT group (44.1%) and in the HBOT improved group (31.6%), when compared with that of the control group (84.4%). The mean healing rate of ulcers was significantly higher in the HBOT group (41.2%) and in the HBOT improved group (57.9%), when compared with that of the control group (3.1%). The mean rate of “major” amputation was less in the HBOT group (23.5%), and in the HBOT improved and failure groups (21.1% and 26.7%, respectively), when compared with that of the control group (53.1%). The mean healing rate of ulcers was higher, but not statistically significant, in the HBOT failure group (20%), when compared with that of the control group (3.1%).Conclusions: The outcome of chronic diabetic lower-extremity ulcers non-healed after HBOT was significantly better, when compared with that of the non-HBOT treated diabetic lower-limb ulcers, over a mean follow-up period of about 4 years."

In December 2004 he had acute hepatitis B with stage 4 encephalopathy and a severe coagulation disorder. He started Lamivudine 100mg per day and was proposed for hepatic transplant, but there was a significant neurological, clinical and analytic improvement. One month after acute hepatitis, serologic tests showed cured hepatitis B and the quantitative RNA HCV test was not detectable for the next nine months.Discussion and Conclusion: Supportive treatment is the classical management of acute Hepatitis B. However, there are some studies concerning the use of some antiviral agents, to improve the cure rate and prognosis. There are a few published cases of clearance of HCV after acute Hepatitis B. The authors carried out a literature search of the pathophysiology and interactions of HBV, HCV, immunologic system and the effect of Lamivudin in this situation."

The authors report the case of a 59 year–old male with a pathological background of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia who developed acute paresis of the right arm, starting on awakening, without any history of trauma or fever. The investigation carried out revealed negative serology for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and VDRL. RMI of the right shoulder detected a dystrophic disorder of the supraspinatus and electromyography showed abnormality of nerve conduction, highly suggestive of Parsonage-Turner syndrome.The authors discuss the differential diagnosis and details of this relatively rare syndrome."

It arises within the bone marrow of the vertebral body, causing pain and neurologic symptoms due to bone destruction with fracture and collapse, visible on imagiologic studies as osteolytic lesions usually associated with adjacent soft tissue masses. The duration of symptomatology can be of several years before diagnosis, although clinical deterioration may be rapid and severe, with acute neurologic compression, radiculopathy, myelopathy and paraplegia, leading to the necessity of emergency surgery. The prognosis after total excision and spinal stabilization is generally excellent, as patients with solitary amyloidoma have no known risk of development of multiple myeloma or systemic amyloidosis. The authors report the case of a patient with solitary amyloidoma of the lumbar spine who unfortunately had a dismal outcome, due to acute nosocomial pneumonia and sepsis by Acinetobacter baumanii and extended-spectrum β-lactamase Escherichia coli occurring after open spinal biopsy."

It has been recently considered as an independent marker of bad prognosis and of raised mortality. The aggressive control of the glycaemia levels has been recognized in several reference studies as an important therapy target for the treatment of serious acute illness. It can also be related to the improvement of the clinical results and a significant reduction of mortality. Diabetic patients are prone to a more frequent and longer hospitalization and to a larger number of surgical interventions. It is justifiably associated with an increased morbidity and mortality rate. Consequently, it requires a specific therapy strategy, which would improve its prognosis.This paper aims at presenting the diabetic patient’s preparation for the operation, as well as the main insulin treatments in the perioperative period.

                    "The new definition of acute myocardial infarction includes acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated troponin levels in patients without ST – segment elevation (NSTEMI). The world of patients with myocardial necrosis now diagnosed is much larger and we need to study the evolution of this new entity.Objectives: The present study aimed to determine the influence of elevated CK and CKMB levels in acute coronary syndromes with elevated troponin levels in patients presenting without ST-segment elevation, in terms of clinical characteristics, evolution and prognosis.Methods: For 8 months, we studied sequentially all new admissions of patients with ACS – NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels in our Intensive Care Unit. We compared the population with a CK and CK-MB pathologically elevated level (both: CK level more then twice its normal maximal level and a CKMB level greater than10% of CK level) with the group of patients with no elevation of these markers. Patients with elevation of only one parameter (CK or CK-MB) were included in the second group. The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors, previous history, clinical and angiographical characteristics and evolution at 30 days and 6 months.Results: From the 75 patients with ACS-NSTEMI (52 men), with the mean age of 68.4 +-10.4 years, 43 (57%) had elevated CK and CKMB levels and the other 32 had elevated troponin levels without elevation of CK and CKMB levels.Comparing the two groups, they were similar in terms of age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, but those without CK elevation levels had more frequently a previous myocardial infarction (31 versus 19, p<0.05). The coronary morphology was not different, and the clinical evolution was similar, at 30 days and after 6 months. There was no significant difference in terms of re-infarction, need for revascularization and coronary mortality. However, there was a significantly positive correlation between previous myocardial infarction and the total cardiovascular mortality (0.43, p<0.01).Conclusions: ACS-NSTE with elevated troponin level is a new entity with a similar evolution to the previously described non-Q wave infarction. The prognosis is the same whether or not there is an elevation of CK and CKMB levels.In our study, we verified that ACS – NSTEMI without elevated CK and CKMB levels presented more frequently in patients with previous infarction (p<0.05), and there was a positive correlation with total cardiovascular mortality at 6 months (p<0.01) in this group of patients."

A 27-year-old man presented with a slight liver enzyme increase on routine blood analysis. Ultrasonography, CT and MRI were performed and showed a solitary mass in the left hepatic lobe, characteristic of FNH. The patient was followed up over seven years. He became progressively symptomatic with epigastric pain and postprandial fullness and underwent surgical resection which resulted in symptomatic relief. The other case is a 42-year-old female, who had been taking oral contraceptives, with three hepatic masses seen ultrasonically on a liver scan performed to investigate unspecific abdominal pain. MRI confirmed the diagnosis of FNH. The patient has been followed-up for two years and remains asymptomatic. The authors decided to present these cases because of their atypical features. In the first one: it is unusual to make a diagnosis of FNH in male patients and cases are rarely symptomatic with the need for surgical resection. In the second one: multiple lesions are rare. The controversial question of the association between oral contraceptives and FNH is raised."

Extensive vascular calcification in the large abdominal arteries, including the right renal artery, was detected by adrenal computed tomography and prompted further radiological exams, namely magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries and aorta, and complete aortic arteriography. The findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis.

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis, presenting furthermore inflammation of the pulmonary trunk.

Multiple physiological mechanisms, which are activated as a result of hyperbaric oxygenation (mechanical effect of increased pressure, toxic gas increased wash out, hyperoxygenation, vasoconstriction, fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, leukocyte oxidative bacterial killing, toxin inhibition, bacteriostasis, bacterial killing, antibiotic synergy) explain the many beneficial effects of HBOT in several pathological conditions, caused, worsened or perpetuated by hypoxia or gas bubbles trapped in the body, such as: decompression sickness, air embolus syndrome, carbon monoxide intoxication and acute cyanide poisoning, clostridial gas gangrene, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, chronic osteomyelitis, chronic wounds, radiation-induced injury, crush injuries, compartment syndrome, graft and flap salvage, oedema, sepsis, acute burns, severe blood loss anemia, and many others.The present work provides an overview concerning some historical aspects, physiological effects, clinical applications, and secondary effects of HBOT."

There is a higher prevalence with increasing age, affecting 2 to 7% of the elderly. If mild to moderate, it is well tolerated and usually asymptomatic. When severe, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Conventionally, aortic stenosis is considered a degenerative process, in which damage to the valve has occurred due to time and usage. However, only few elderly patients have aortic stenosis, even in bicuspid valves. Beyond the degenerative process which develops with age, other factors seem to be involved in the development of the disease. Risk-benefit analysis favours an early surgical intervention, bearing in mind the excellent surgical technique involved and consequent low risk associated with valvular substitution."

Setting: medical-surgical intensive care unit with 14 bedsDesign: retrospective case-control studyMethods: 43 patients who underwent OLT were included in the study. Twenty-three patients had a favourable evolution and constituted the control group; 20 patients presented complications (9 of which were vascular) and were classified in 2 sub-groups based on serum liver parameters: hepatocellular (aminotransferase elevations) and cholestatic (serum elevation of gama-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin). The following parameters were evaluated: age, gender, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation duration, APACHE II and SAPS II scores. The initial serum values of several biochemical parameters were registered and compared when an increase was found (1.5 - 2 times the prior value). Results: The patients with complications were predominantly female (p=0.047), presented longer hospitalization time (p<0.001) and had higher SAPS II scores (p<0.001). The initial lactate values were higher in the complicated group (9.4 versus 6.7 mmol/L, p=0.0046). Vascular complications correlated with a hepatocellular pattern. A 1.5 fold increase in lactate correlated with any complication and a 2-fold increase with hepatocellular complications. Using multivariate analysis, this variation in serum lactate was independently related to occurrence of any complication (CI 1.18-1.64, p=0.003).Conclusions: Complicated post-OLT patients presented a higher initial lactate value. Post-operative complications in the ICU correlated with 1.5-fold increase in serum lactate, while a 2-fold increase correlated with hepatocellular complications, especially those of vascular origin. Serum lactate may be a useful monitoring tool of complications in OLT patients in the ICU"

Among the parameters studied, the difference between the initial and the final value was statistically significant for the CD4 count, serum albumin, phase angle and for the extracellular mass/body cell mass index. There were no such differences found for body mass index, lean body mass, and body cell mass.The 35 patients were divided in two groups, one with no AIDS defining event and the other with progression to AIDS. Between those two groups of patients, there were no statistically significant differences. It was concluded that a systematic and timely metabolic and nutritional evaluation allows body composition changes to be detected, even before they become clinically or biochemically evident."

It´s essential to maintain SaO2 > 94%, to promote vasodilatation by nitrates use, to force the diuresis with furosemide (continuous infusion after intravenous bolus) and correct the metabolic disturbances and organ-specific dysfunctions (particularly the renal one).Further specific therapies (e.g., the use of inotropic agents), should be administered based on the clinical and haemodynamic characteristics of the patient who does not respond to initial treatment.

The efficacy of treatment with erythropoietic proteins (EPO) in MDS is controversial and the cost/benefit relationship is being questionedObjective: To evaluate retrospectively the response to EPO in patients diagnosed with MDS, followed in our Haemato-oncology outpatient department. Method: A retrospective study of all patients, followed over the last 5 years in the Haemato-oncology outpatient department, diagnosed with MDS and treated with EPO, were included. We analyzed demographic parameters, clinical data and treatment. Results: 5 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, four of whom were males. The average diagnostic age was 73.4 years. In 80% of cases the patients presented with symptomatic anaemia. The average Hb. pre-treatment was 9 g/dl. 60% of the patients responded to the treatment with an average increase of 3.1 g/dl after 1 month of subcutaneous α-EPO 40.000 UI / weekly. In the responders group there were no treatment complications and none needed blood transfusion.Conclusions: EPO is a therapeutic option in the complicated approach to MDS. In ours patients 60% responded successfully to the treatment without complications. Responders did not require blood transfusion"

Although diagnosis is clinical, the predictive value of the associated signs and symptoms is unknown.Objectives: To identify clinical and laboratory features, possible to obtain in the Emergency Room, that correlate with a diagnosis of MSF, in patients with fever and rash.Methods: A prospective study was conducted, between 1st January and 31st December 2002, that included all patients admitted with fever and rash. A clinical and laboratory evaluation was performed, along with serological screening for Rickettsiae, Borreliae, Ehrlichiae, Epstein Barr, HIV, Echo, Coxsackie, Salmonellae, Leptospirae, Treponema, Rheumatic fever, endocarditis and lupus. The correlation between the clinical and laboratory data and a definitive diagnosis of Rickettsiosis was studied using the Chi-square (or Fisher, when necessary) test. Logistic regression was used to study the predictive value of the variables with a statistically significant correlation.Results: 55 patients where admitted with fever and rash, in whom MSF was confirmed in 44. The mean age was 60.7 years and 46.7% were male. Only an admission diagnosis of MSF had a statistically significant correlation with that same definitive diagnosis (p=0.008).Conclusions: In this study, only an admission diagnosis of MSF had a statistically significant correlation with that same definitive diagnosis (odds ratio 10.7). The week of admission had a weak statistical significance (p=0.049, and odds ratio 4.0)."

                    "Introduction and objectives: The indwelling urinary tract catheter (IUTC) is an important part of medical care. Up to 25% of patients admitted in hospitals are catheterized, of which, a high percentage are not justified. Catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common nosocomial infection documented, accounting for more than 40% of the total.Almost all patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward in our hospital, pass through the Emergency Department, where they stay until there is a bed available. Therefore, a high number of patients have an IUTC at the time of medical ward admission. With this study we pretended to analyse the incidence of CAUTI in patients catheterized after hospital admission. Material and methods: Over a seven month time period, all the patients admitted to the medical ward with an IUTC, were included in the study. The urinary catheter was left in situ in those who had a clear indication. If no need for catheterisation was found, a urine sample was collected for culture, and the IUTC removed. Patients admitted with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection were excluded.In the study population we studied the motive stated for catheterization, the sex/age distribution, the percentage of positive urine cultures and the pathogens involved. Results: During this study, 15% (n=60) of the admitted patients had an IUTC. The reason stated for catheterization was to measure urinary output in 66.7% of the patients, urinary retention in 10% and no justification determined in 21.7% of the cases. In the studied population 93.3% (n=56) had no indication to maintain the IUTC. The results of the urine culture performed in these patients were positive in 23.2% (n=13), all with a IUTC in place for more than 3 days. Of those who had a negative urine culture result (n=40), 65% had already been medicated with a broad spectrum antibiotic for more then 48 hours; this fact could underestimate the number of CAUTI."

There were 923 patients assisted of whom 74 had a history of cancer (excluding cancer associated with HIV infection). Of these, 31% were newly diagnosed cases, 26% were patients admitted for a complication directly involved with the disease and in 43% the cause of admission was not related to cancer. The most prevalent cancer was of the breast, although the most commonly diagnosed were those of the haematopoietic and gynaecological systems. Most cases (73%) presented in stage IV and had a mortality of 24%, higher than the overall mortality mean (9%). There was a high percentage of anaemia among these patients (66.7%) as well as a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (93.1%).

The out-patient colonoscopic and upper gastro-duodenal endoscopic studies were inconclusive. She presented with a decline in general status, asthenia and anorexia of two months duration, as well as dark stools and tachycardia, four days before hospitalization. Physical examination revealed pallor of skin and mucosae and vital signs were stable. Analyses showed a normochromic, normocytic anaemia (5.7 g/dl), without signs of haemolysis, serum iron =7 ug/dl, transferrin saturation= 24.5 %, reticulocytes = 6%, RDW increased; normal levels of serum electrolytes, normal renal and thyroid function tests; negative tumour markers and increased ESR (124 mm/h). Stool occult blood was positive in three samples. A repeat upper gastro-duodenal endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative. Barium radiographic studies did not show images suggestive of tumour or infiltrative injury. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound showed an image compatible with an intra-abdominal heterogeneous mass. CT scan revealed a mass in the right lower abdominal, probably an ileal lesion, with 6 cm of longitudinal diameter suggestive of a tumour; a small amount of ascites but without evidence of lymph node involvement in the main abdominal and pelvic chains. She underwent a segmental enterectomy and appendicectomy. Histological examination showed malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST) with signs of muscular differentiation, positive C-Kit. At present, after two years of follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic."

On the other hand, there are more and more important breakthroughs in Biomedical Research (immunology, immunogenetics, etc.) and medical practitioners are slow in integrating these breakthroughs into their daily clinical practice. For this reason, this study proposes a holistic handling of the patient — which the author calls Integrated Clinical Approach — and, to illustrate this “methodology” in a concrete manner, he offers an example of the study and treatment of a serious case of multiple cystic echinococcosis."

We highlight Medline using the PubMed interface, giving examples of the consistency and precision of the results when the controlled language of Medical Subject Heading is used. Amongst the various examples given, the use of My NCBI to customize PubMed is emphasized, in order to save and store searches that can be run over periodically.The suggestions presented emphasise the necessary skills needed to perform a successful search to help the user to find more and better knowledge."

                    "Introduction: The Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) is an instrument to measure the appropriateness of admissions based on criteria that permit classification of hospital admission as appropriate or inappropriate. It also could be used to quantify and evaluate the causes of inappropriate use of hospital resources. Objective: Evaluate the appropriateness of hospital admissions of patients admitted in a department of Internal Medicine during the year of 2004, using the prospective version of the AEP.Method: Prospective and random study of the patients admitted in an Internal Medicine department during the year of 2004. We analyzed demographic, clinical (readmissions, co-morbidility and mortality) and administration parameters (hospitalization duration and appropriateness of hospital admission using the AEP, including causes of inappropriateness). Results: 72 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria with an average age of 70.6 years. 42% were readmissions. The average hospital stay was 7.2 days. Mortality rate was 11.3%. 20.8% of the admissions were considered inappropriate because they did not fulfill any AEP criteria. The most common reason for inappropriate admission was to perform diagnostic exams or treatments that could have been done on an outpatient basis (53.3%).The most common criteria of appropriateness was the need for intravenous therapy (87%), followed by the need for assisted ventilation (12.3%). Conclusions: The AEP allows us to evaluate the appropriateness of hospital admissions in a Health Unit, enabling better utilization of resources. A 20,8% rate of inappropriate admissions was recorded, similar to that found in other studies. The creation of a structure that improves the study of outpatient utilization could decrease inappropriateness of inpatient admissions."

The majority of the physicians (90.2%) say they prescribe generic drugs but less than half (45%) of these authorize substitution. It seems there is no relation between knowledge and prescription habits. The lack of confidence in the quality of generic drugs was the biggest obstacle concerning generic prescription.Conclusions: The data collected suggests that knowledge is not the only factor that influences prescribing habits. Future educational activities to increase knowledge about generic drugs should aim at the quality of the prescribing habits and not only attempt to increase the pharmaceutical market of generic drugs per se."

The relevance of this presentation, a relatively frequent condition usually treated by other medical specialities, resides in the fact that it was observed and treated by internists because of the systemic form of presentation (which is associated with a high mortality rate). The evolution was favourable after treatment with an appropriate antibacterial agent. The patient was discharged free of symptoms. We took the opportunity to present a bibliographic revision, highlighting the medical (as opposed to the surgical) approach and management of this infection."

                    "Background: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a very frequent arrhythmia. A devastating consequence of AF is stroke and 15% of all strokes are caused by AF. Several trials have proved a significant reduction in the risk of stroke with anticoagulation (AC). New guidelines have suggested AC for at least three weeks after cardioversion and long term AC for patients older than 75 years with AF, as well as those with risk factors for a thromboembolic event. Long-term AC in the community is safe and effective, even in the elderly. However, some physicians avoid prescribing AC.Objectives: Determine the prevalence of AF in patients attending the Internal Medicine Department of Fernando Fonseca Hospital, over the last 9 years; study the prevalence of stroke in these patients; determine the use of AC at discharge of patients with AF in 2004.Design: retrospective, event driven clinical database analysis.Results: In 9 years AF was found in 6.7% (927/13800) of patients. In 2004, 122 patients with AF were hospitalised and 17.2% had cerebrovascular disease. AC on discharge was noted in only 22.2% of these patients. Conclusions: Even though it has been proved that AC reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF, in general practice the number of patients anticoagulated is small. We must change this attitude in order to reduce the morbility and mortality associated to stroke, the leading cause of death in our country."

Objectives: The main goal of this work was to assess the adequacy of the risk classes defi ned according to the PSI-20 and hospital admission recommendations, as applied to our population. We also wanted to know the demographic characteristics and other factors which affect mortality.Methods: Retrospective study of all the patients admitted with CAP to our infi rmary over a one-year period. The 20 PSI variables were collected and the patients stratifi ed into risk classes (I-V).Results Overall, 262 inpatients with CAP were included; 60% were males, and 40% females, with a mean age of 72.9 years. No signifi cant differences were observed in mortality regarding sex, place of residence or presence of co-morbid conditions, but there was a signifi cant difference in relation to age.Treatment was empirical, with advantage for patients treated with a combination of antibiotics. The distribution of the patients across the risk classes was: Class I – 2.3%, Class II – 8.8%, Class III – 16.0%, Class IV – 45.0% and Class V – 27.9%. The mortality in each class in our series was similar to the mortality in the PSI study except for Class II (death of a patient with a severe co-morbid condition). Conclusions: The PSI-based model performed well when applied to our population. Most of the low risk-classes (I-III) patients could have been safely treated as outpatients."

Despite the absence of respiratory, cardiac, pulmonary or genito-urinary complaints, the initial analytical assessment detected leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, normocytic normochromic anaemia and discrete renal failure. The patient was admitted to clarify the clinical picture and, if possible, to exclude underlying systemic disease.The diagnosis was found to be pyoderma gangrenosum associated with systemic vasculitis, probably Wegener’s granulomatosis.Early haemodialysis was necessary due to rapid and progressive renal dysfunction. Nevertheless, therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants markedly improved skin lesions and renal function was restored."

                    "Angioedema, a rare potentially severe disease, is characterized by recurrent, circumscribed, solitary or multiple subcutaneous and mucosal swelling, involving the extremities, face, larynx and bowel wall. Bradykinin appears to be the main mediator of episodes. Angioedema is due to hereditary or acquired varieties of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency, each one comprising two types. In type 1 hereditary angioedema both C1INH protein level and function in plasma are decreased; whereas in type 2 hereditary angioedema the C1INH level is normal or elevated, but C1INH function is decreased due to synthesis of dysfunctional C1INH. In type 1 acquired angioedema there is depressed functional C1INH activity, which is frequently associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, whereas in type 2 acquired angioedema there is the presence of anti-C1INH autoantibodies, often monoclonal, but without proven associated malignant disease. The attacks are caused by several conditions. Based on a case of atypical acquired angioedema in a 49-year old man, responding favourably to cinnarizine and alcohol abstinence, the authors provide a concise review of both types of angioedema, portending to pathogenic mechanisms, aetiology of attacks, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis of both types of angioedema by quantifi cation of the C1 complement fraction determination, and the available therapeutic possibilities. Cinnarizine was prescribed due to presumed alcoholic liver disease. The clinically signifi cant improvement, was however not associated with concomitant good laboratory results, which is a relatively common occurrence."

                    "Background: Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is a method of alveolar ventilation, which has been shown to be effi cient and safe in patients with chronic or acute respiratory insuffi ciency. Our experience with NIV, in a Medical Intermediate-Care-Unit, over a 2-year period, is presented.Methods: A retrospective study of 66 patients who were treated with NIV, in the medical intermediate care unit (MICU) of the Garcia de Orta Hospital, between January of 2001 and December 2002 was performed. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were analysed.Results: Of 315 patients admitted to the MICU, 66 (20%) were ventilated non-invasively. Fifty-three percent were male and the mean age was 68 years. The main underlying conditions leading to NIV were Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in 33 patients (50%), Pneumonia in 12 (18%), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in 9 (14%), Post-Extubation-Syndrome (PES) in 6 (9%), Pickwick Disease in 4 (6%), Kyphoscoliosis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) one of each. The interface most commonly selected for NVI was the face mask (98%). After 48 hours of ventilation, signifi cant improvement of gas exchange was achieved in 61% of patients. Nine patients deteriorated clinically within this period, of whom, three needed to be transferred to an intensive care unit for invasive ventilation and 3 patients died. The mean length of stay in the MICU was 8.5 days, with a mean time of ventilation of 6.4 days ( 8.8 in CHF, 7 in PES, 6 in COPD and 3.8 in Pneumonia). Invasive ventilation was necessary in 11 patients, 4 with COPD, 3 with pneumonia, 2 with CHF, 1 with Pickwick disease and 1 with PES. Nine percent of the patients, all suffering from COPD, continued NIV after discharge on an outpatient basis. The overall mortality of patients undergoing NIV was 21%.Conclusion and Discussion: NIV lead to signifi cant improvement in gas exchange in 61% of patients, within the fi rst 48 hours. Patients with COPD, CHF and pneumonia had the highest benefi t, the latter requiring the shortest time of ventilation."

This is always associated with therapeutic futility including the trend to defi ne the extent of treatment according to available resources.The article concludes that it is necessary to recover the objectives of Hipocratic medicine which place value on the person, their values and choices; to recognize when curative medicine should be replaced by palliative.The article ends by drawing attention to Portugal and the guidelines issued in 1995 by the Conselho Nacional de Ética (National Council of Ethics) para as Ciencias da vida about the ethical aspects of health care related to the end of life."

Admitting patients with low probability of having an Acute Coronary Syndrome may become unaffordable both financially and logistically; on the other side of this delicate balance is the risk of misdiagnosis. Cardiac biomarkers are the third essential element in the diagnostic approach of Acute Coronary Syndromes, in addition to clinical symptoms and the results of the electrocardiogram. The clinical evaluation is often limited by atypical symptoms and not infrequently the initial electrocardiogram is nondiagnostic. In these patients with atypical presentations of Acute Coronary Syndromes the quantification of cardiac biomarkers is particularly important.The knowledge of the release kinetics of theses substances, the techniques used to quantify them, their reference values and their advantages and disadvantages is fundamental in order to use them adequately in a specific clinical context.In addition to their utility in the diagnosis or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction, cardiac biomarkers provide prognostic information (risk stratification) and are helpful in indicating therapeutic strategies for Acute Coronary Syndromes.This article reviews cardiac biomarkers now available in the hospital practice."

Static parameters such as pressure-derived indices are not useful guides to predict the influence of fluids on cardiac output. Dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness are not well recognized. Investigators who described these dynamic parameters also evaluated the amount of fluids needed to appropriately increase cardiac output, providing a useful guide concerning this particular issue. The usual ways of patient evaluation are not reliable in order to determine whether to opt for fluid therapy or early onset of amine infusion.

Although it is known that many Portuguese internists work in this fi eld, the real dimension of this activity is unknown.Methods: An inquiry was sent by mail to the 118 Internal Medicine departments registered in the Portuguese Internal Medicine Society. The data obtained was put in an electronic database.Results: We had 44 answers from the 118 Internal Medicine departments, of which 37 were from departments with a specifi c activity in autoimmune disease. A total number of 158 internists follow 6.000 to 13.000 patients with autoimmune disease. The most prevalent were Rheumatoid Arthritis (1.181-2.305 patients), Lupus Erythematosus (708-1.395 patients) and Sjögren’s syndrome (320-665 patients). Therapy with anti-TNF agents is given to 135 patients, in 17 departments.Conclusions: In Portugal, internists follow a high number of patients with diverse autoimmune diseases, with a national distribution."

Rickettsia conorii, microorganism responsable for the disease, is a small intracellular gram-negative bacillus, transmitted accidentally to man by the Riphicephalus sanguineus arthropod. The classical triad is characterized by fever, rash (with palm and sole distribution) and black eschar. After a mean incubation period of 3 to 7 days, clinical symptoms appear. Although Mediterranean spotted fever is usually a benign disease, serious complications can occur specially in older patients and patients with underlying chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, heart failure, alcoholism, etc.).The authors conducted a retrospective study of the patients hospitalized in an Internal Medicine ward with Mediterranean spotted fever during a period of 10 years (1994-2003) focusing on the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory manifestations and complications of the disease."

                    "The diagnosis of acute human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) syndrome requires a high index of suspicion and specifi c laboratory testing. Symptoms associated with HIV infection are common among seroconverts, but their non-specifi c nature and the absence of a universally accepted defi nition, makes this a major diagnostic challenge to health care providers. The authors present a case of a 32-year-old man, previously asymptomatic, admitted to our institution because of a mononucleosis-like illness associated with diarrhoea, anorexia, fatigue and weight loss. The physical examination revealed fever, exsudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy and liver enlargement. Laboratory studies indicated anaemia, lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, high liver enzymes and LDH. He denied risk factors for HIV infection and had negative HIV serology 4 months prior to admission (blood donor testing). Despite the serology for EBV being positive, other serologies were asked for, including ELISA for HIV, that confi rmed seroconversion. Colonoscopy and biopsies revealed an unspecifi c infl ammatory colitis, compatible with HIV colitis. Antiretroviral therapy was started and after 4 weeks the patient became asymptomatic, showing an increase in CD4+ cell count and lower viral load. This case illustrates that even in patients without clear risk factors for HIV infection, acute retroviral syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mononucleosis like syndrome. Also a positive serology for EBV doesn’t exclude HIV infection, and the suspicion of acute HIV illness should prompt virology analysis. Recognition of acute retroviral syndrome helps us to limit transmission and probably to improve the prognosis of these patients with the possibility of early treatment."

The increasing number of cases and a mortality rate of 51%, has lead to fears that should the virus acquire the ability to transmit from human to human, a serious world pandemic of H5N1 infl uenza will occur.In order to combat such an eventuality efforts have targeted research and disease control in Asian countries where H5N1 infl uenza cases have been reported. It is possible that these efforts are insuffi cient, and research for a H5N1 specifi c vaccine is being pursued as well as other control measures. One of these measures could be the use of antiviral therapy, such as oseltamivir, aiming to reduce the severity and transmissibility of the disease."

The objective was to look for epidemiological and clinical characteristics that could justify this increase. In 2004 the mean age increased about a decade and the predisposing factors were inverted. Valvular heart disease has assumed relevance and there was a decrease of about 50% in drug abuse and HIV infection among patients with endocarditis. The sub-acute clinical presentation almost doubled and fever was the only manifestation that remained unchanged during these years. The pathogens isolated in blood cultures were different with an important reduction in MRSA. There was an increase in embolic cerebral complications and valvular complications with urgent need for surgery but significantly less mortality. Conclusion: in 2004 there was a signifi cant increase in infectious endocarditis with a change in the epidemiological, clinical and microbiological patterns. A causal factor that could explain all these changes was not identified."

A subgroup of patients was prescribed a quantified caloric restriction diet and data from this group was analysed separately. We compared the mean weights of the total sample obtained at the different evaluation periods and also for each quartile of BMI; the lipid profile was compared at times 0 and 3 months.Results: Considering the whole sample, there was no significant weight variation at any interval considered. In the analysis by BMI quartiles, there was a statistically significant reduction from 3 to 6 months (p=0.014) for the 4th quartile and a borderline significant reduction from 0 to 6 months for the 3rd quartile (p=0.05).In the first 3 months there was a statistically significant reduction of the total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In the subgroup with individually adapted caloric restriction (n=8) there was, during the 1st 3 months, a weight reduction of 2.18 Kg (p=0.033); in the same period, there was no statistically significant variation of the lipid profile, probably due to the reduced sample size.Conclusion: The caloric restriction diet appears to be more effective in weight reduction than the usual lifestyle changes, which, in turn, have a favourable effect in the lipid profile, at least in the short term"

                    "Introduction – Infectious pathology is one of the major causes of hospital admission in the Portuguese Medicine Services. Little data concerning the Portuguese reality is available and as such we are obliged at times to extrapolate from data of other countries.Objectives – To determine the characteristics of infectious pathology in a Portuguese Medicine Service.Methods – A 6-month prospective systematic study in a University Central Hospital Medicine Service was carried out. All patients diagnosed with an infectious pathology, either on admission or after bacteriologic or serologic studies, were included in the study. Results – 228 patients met the study inclusion criteria, 59% were female and the average age was 69.9 years. The most frequent infections were respectively: respiratory (83) and urinary (46). The most frequent cultural examinations required were blood culture for aerobes (194), urine cultures (187) and blood cultures for anaerobes (55). Percentage of positive identifi cation of infectious agents from cultural examinations was: blood cultures for aerobes 10.3%; urine cultures 25.7%; blood cultures for anaerobes 0% and sputum cultures 7.5%. In the 83 patients diagnosed with a respiratory infection, 4 agents were isolated and one serology were positive; the most frequent first line antibiotic therapy prescribed was amoxycillin + clavulanic acid. In the 46 patients diagnosed with urinary infection, 51 agents were isolated, 31 were community acquired infections and 20 nosocomial, predominantly Escherichia coli; the antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent agents was determined; the most frequently prescribed fi rst line antibiotic therapy was: cephradine (34.4%), amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (31.2%) and ciprofl oxacin (21.9%). First line antibiotic therapy used was changed in 27.2% of cases, the chief reason for alteration was a weak clinical response.Discussion – The study sample refl ects the reality of infectious disease pathology in a Portuguese Medical Service. The cultural examinations were requested in accordance with the most frequent infectious diseases diagnosed. The profitability of the cultural examinations is the same as that found in international series, with the exception of low infectious agent isolation in sputum cultures and anaerobes in blood cultures. The low number of isolates in respiratory infections does not allow for conclusions to be drawn. The rate of isolated agents in community and nosocomial urinary infections is similar to that reported in international data. This study showed that nitrofurantoin and cephradine were the best antibiotic agents for community acquired urinary infections. The antibiotic therapy initially prescribed was sufficient in most cases and was altered in about 25% of cases. This small study represents some of the Portuguese reality and needs to be repeated, with a larger sample size, in order to draw firm conclusions and define the most adequate diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for our reality."

Therapy with corticosteroids and implantation of bilateral ureteral stents were decided in view of laboratory signs of persistence of disease activity. The clinical and laboratory evolution was good and ureteral stents were removed at four months duration of corticosteroid therapy. A slow and progressive lower dosage of corticosteroids do not caused a recurrence of the disease, but due to the persistence of imagiological signs of ureteral dilation, azatioprine was associated to corticosteroids, trying to maintain stabilization of the disease without needing to recur to ureterolysis surgery.The authors made bibliographic review of data on idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, focusing on etiopathogeny, clinical presentation and diagnosis, therapy and prognosis."

We designed the present study to evaluate the diagnostic potential and the therapeutic implications of FBC in our ICU.Methods: Retrospective study of 95 FBC performed in a medico-surgical ICU. Indications, complication rate, endoscopic findings, additional studies performed during endoscopy, microbiologic studies and their implication in antibiotherapy were evaluated.Findings: FBC was performed to evaluate pneumonia in 48 cases, atelectasis in 24 and aspiration pneumonia in 21 cases. Identifi cation of an infectious agent in patients with pneumonia was achieved in 32 cases resulting in an antibiotic regimen change in 26 of them. Atelectasis was confirmed in 20 of the 24 cases and aspiration pneumonia in only 3 cases. Mucosal infl ammation and bronchial secretions were the most common endoscopic findings and complication rate was low (transitory hypoxaemia in 10 cases).Conclusions: FBC is an endoscopic technique with a low rate of complications and can be very useful in the study of pulmonary disease in mechanically ventilated patients. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of FBC depends mostly on careful patient selection."

On admission he had bite marks of moderate to severe gravity – the upper right limb was extremely swollen, bruised and a haemorrhagic blister was present on the hand. Laboratory abnormalities suggesting acute renal injury, rhabdomyolisis and a consumptive coagulopathy were detected. The time period from snake-bite to treatment surpassed the period for anti-venom administration. The patient was treated conservatively, showed clinical and laboratory improvement and was discharged from hospital ten days later. The difference between venomous snakes and inoffensive ones, as well as the complications of snake bite, treatment and indications for anti-venom are discussed."

On immunosupressive therapy (prednisone and cyclophosphamide), the fever, asthma and hypereosinophilia disappeared rapidly, but the neurological symptoms persisted although with prolonged therapy the neuropathy fi nely improved . This case illustrates the distinct effects of the therapy on the different components of the Churg-Strauss Syndrome, probably as a consequence of the different immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in these two manifestations of the CSS.."

The fi rst reports of these compounds date from the 1940’s. Several studies suggest that the eastern female population does not suffer the same adverse symptoms associated with the menopause as western women. This fact is related to the high intake of soya in the normal asian diet. Presently, there is still a worrying lack of incontrovertible studies on the potential benefits of phytoestrogens. Despite some recent advances achieved in this area there is still much to discover and explore. The objective of this review is to resume what is know to date concerning phytoestrogens and to try to evaluate the relevance for human nutrition, especially with respect to target populations"

                    "In the last fi fty years the technical and scientifi c advances in fifty years the technical and scientific advances in the area of medicine have introduced into clinical practice new concepts of death, the diagnosis of which entails the production of an elaborate list of evidence. The coexistence of various criteria of death has been a controversial issue and subject to intense debate.With discussions caught up in a stalemate of unclear concepts and defi nitions, criteria of cerebral death were ratifi ed in most countries. Portugal adopted the death of the brain stem as the criterion that has been applied since 1994.In this article, after putting the issue into historical perspective, the different defi nitions, criteria and testing of death are revised, mainly from an ethical point of view, in reference to the main arguments put forth by advocates of each position.It is concluded that the inexistence of a single concept of death, together with the variation of criteria and testing methods are the evidence of the weakness of these defi nitions. Therefore clinical situations which are considered irreversible may no longer be so, depending on the scientifi c knowledge about the physiopathology of diseases and therapeutic resources. In relation to the tests used in the diagnosis of death, it is concluded that performing the apnea testing violates the most elementary rules employed to avoid irreversible brain damage in the treatment of patients with intracranial hypertension.This makes a serious effort of therapeutic investigation into the situations of coma and apnea mandatory at the same time as an overall revision of testing methods in order to exclude the apnea testing."

As the condition evolved, the jaundice became worse and the total bilirubin reached 18.5 mg/dl.The aetiological investigation of the patient’s liver disease excluded the most common bacterial and viral agents, as well as the autoimmune and metabolic causes. Liver biopsy was compatible with Acute Hepatitis. With the hypothesis of acute iatrogenic hepatitis being considered, all drugs were suspended. The clinical picture remained unresolved and corticotherapy was introduced with good clinical results.

METHODS: We studied the subgroup of non-diabetic patients from our Lipidology / Dyslipidemia outpatient clinic who were treated with metformin as first lipid lowering drug (n=17), and evaluated the lipid profile before and 3 months after introducing the drug. We compared the baseline characteristics of this group with those of a sample of non-diabetic dyslipidemic patients treated differently. RESULTS: Three months after introducing metformin, there was a 41,8% significant reduction of triglycerides (p=0.006), as well as a 10.4% reduction of total cholesterol and a 5.9% raise of HDL cholesterol, which did not reach statistical significance. LDL cholesterol did not vary significantely.The non-diabetic patients who were treated with metformin had lower mean HDL cholesterol and higher mean triglycerides than the other non-diabetics. CONCLUSION: Metformin emerges as a good lipid-lowering drug in non-diabetic patients, particularly for patients with hypertriglyceridemia and other features of the metabolic syndrome."

Diagnosis is based on histopathological findings, being important to consider differential diagnosis with infectious, autoimmune and lymphoproliferative lymphadenopathies. This disease has a good prognosis without therapy, nevertheless, if necessary, nonsteroid anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAID’s) or low dose corticosteroids are used.The authors present a case of a 26 years old woman with cervical bilateral lymphadenopathies and malaise. The histological result of an excised lymph node was histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. Evolution was excellent and the patient was assymptomatic without any treatment."

The clinical evolution was quite typical, progressing from an insidious febrile syndrome to an acute left ventricular failure. The isolated agent was a Streptococcus mitis, which, in presence of multiple gengivo-dental infections (with poor oral and dental higyene), sugests an oropharingeal primary site of infection.Based on this case, the authors performed a literature revision about prosthetic valve endocarditis, with special incidence on aortic valve. Clinical history, therapeutic options and some epidemiologic data are also discussed."

The diagnosis was only possible with repeated cutaneous byopsies and in late stage of the disease. The patient died following a fatal and rapid leukemia transformation of the lymphoma. Often, the histological aspects of the skin,in early stages of T.C.C.L., does not reveal malignant characteristics. The diagnosis is frequently delayed due to lack of symptoms and dubious hystology, contribuing to the late institution of therapy. The differential diagnosis of T.C.C.L. is established with cutaneous manifestations of autoimmune diseases and end-stage Blastic NK lymphoma, requiring sofisticated laboratorial techniques such as skin, bone marrow and peripheral blood immunophenotyping."

                    "In recent years, several compact, lightweight, fully functional devices have appeared allowing real-time echocardiography. These hand-held devices may be useful in different situations and be part of a complete physical examination at the bedside, as well as the stethoscope has been since its introduction by Laennec.Portable ultrasound stethoscopes are small computers that have integrated 2 dimensional control settings and a colour power Doppler fl ow mapping. They enable a physician to have an assessment of cardiac morphology, global and regional left ventricle function, performing immediate diagnosis and giving treatment algorithms. The main advantage is to address in loco a specifi c question raised by the assistant physician. Its use in emergency departments, on wards, and in outpatient settings contributes to a further improvement in patient care, giving a new dimension to the relationship doctor/patient. It will permit to the assistant physician to refer a patient to a specifi c specialist more rapidly. The application of these devices obliges non-cardiologists to get some training in the context of echocardiology, specially focused in the use of effi cient, less expensive, hand-held systems, which can rapidly reach different patients settings. Through the implementation of portable echocardiography in health care institutions waiting periods for cardiac examinations will become shorter, with a signifi cantly improvement in costs reduction and quality management."

                    "Introduction and Objectives – Coimbra´s University Hospital has a significant rate of Internal Transfers (IT). The authors analysed this parameter in the Internal Medicine department - Service II with the objective of evaluating the departments’ interface, namely resource utilisation and cooperation with other departments of the same Hospital.Material and methods – Amongst the admissions to the Internal Medicine department - Service II, the ones with a discharge date between the January 1st 2000 and December 31st 2001 were selected. General indicators and indication for transfer were studied, particularly the subgroups involving transfers to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Surgical procedures (Cir). The economic impact was quantified using relative weight methodology and financial determinations were based on the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG).Results – The number of IT episodes was 154 (6.3 % of the admissions to the Internal Medicine department - Service II). The mortality rate was 16.2 % and the average length of admission was 27.7 days (higher than the Internal Medicine department – Service II general average – 8.9 % and 8.7 days). The most significant IT target department from the Internal Medicine department – Service II was General Surgery (34 %). On the other hand, the ICU showed the highest rate of IT (4.8 %) to the Internal Medicine department – Service II. The subgroups involving Surgery (n=53; 34.4 %) and ICU (n=43; 27.9 %) showed a different profile from the overall number of transfers, namely the admission days attributed to the Internal Medicine department – Service II of the ICU patients (n=431) and urgent surgery (n=24). The impact on the DRG financial reimbursement in the IT group was significant.Conclusions – The authors outline some aspects of the analysis: 1. The IT corresponded to a more differentiated care group; 2. The importance of the post-ICU care group in the overall results signalled the need for human and material resources adequate for proper care of these patients; 3. The existence of non-programmed surgery as a point of interest, namely the need for accurate identification in the emergency room of the cases with surgical indication; 4. The importance of the IT parameter in the model for financial evaluation of the Integrated Responsibility Centres (IRC)."

                    "Background: In the last years we have watched the growth of the burden of disease linked to the use of illicit drugs, especially infectious diseases, leading to hospital admission.These admissions are frequently complicated by problems related to the state of physical and psychological dependency, notably the withdrawal syndrome, disruptive behavior andn discharge from the hospital against medical advice.The authors intended to characterize the impact of this population in an internal medicine ward during the year of 1998.Methods: All patient files from the year of 1998 of an Internal Medicine ward were reviewed and two different groups were identified: the first one included the patients who were using illicit drugs at the time of admission (TD group); the second one included all the other patients admitted (control group).The causes of admission, as well as the duration of hospital stay and mortality rate were identified for all patients. Biographical data (sex and age) was also noted, as well as all infectious episodes (on admission and nosocomial) and positive serologies for immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV).For drug users the patterns of use were analysed, as well as complications during hospital stay (especially the withdrawal syndrome).Results: During the year of 1998, 80 active drug users were admitted (5,8% of all admissions): 50 men (7,1%) and 30 women (4,5%). The average age was 31 years in the TD group and 68,5 years in the control group.Among drug users 70% had positive serology for HIV and 48,7% for HCV (in the control group the prevalence was 2,4% and 1,2%, respectively). The mortality rate was respectively 11,3% and 12,7% in TD group and control group, and the length of stay was of 18,7 and 16 days.We identified 46 cases of tuberculosis (18,8% of the TD group and 2,4% of the control group), 293 of pneumonia (28,7% and 21%) and 54 of soft tissues infection (27,5% and 1,5%, respectively). Only 4 cases of endocarditis (2 in each group) and 6 of acute hepatitis (all in drug users) were found.In the TD group 33 episodes of withdrawal syndrome were found (41,3% of this group). Regarding the discharges, 16 (20%) were against medical advice and in 4 of them the diagnosis was tuberculosis.In this population, 10 patients (12,5%) were homeless (9 men and 1 woman) and 66 (82,5%) were injection drug users.Conclusions: During the year of 1998 active drug users represented a significant part of the population admitted to an Internal Medicine ward. Although significantly younger, they had a mortality and lenght of stay similar to the other patients.Infections were the most frequent cause of admission in drug users. A high prevalence of infection by HIV, HCV and tuberculosis in this group was identified.Also relevant is the large number of discharges against medical advice in this population, including some patients with potentially contagious situations."

In this article we emphasize the importance of primary prevention and review risk factors most strongly related to stroke, with special attention to the controllable ones, namely hypertension and dyslipidemia, among others. Recent trials that clarify the role of statins and ACE-inhibitors in primary and secondary stroke prevention are reviewed. The importance of a healthy doctor-patient relationship, as well as the need for global information strategies, are underlined as the fundamental means to achieve patient compliance with the preventive measures proposed."

Complementary diagnostic tests revealed a pernicious anaemia and treatment with Vitamin B12 was started, which resulted in a progressive improvement of the anaemia and remission of the depressive features.Vitamin B12 deficiency may be considered as a possible aetiological factor in the development of clinical depression, particularly those casesrefractory to medical therapy. Awareness of this possibility allows an early diagnosis of a Cyanocobalamin deficiency in cases of atypical refractory depression, avoiding the neurological sequelae."

Adverse effects were spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding with hypovolaemic shock (1), haemorrhagic suffusion with intramuscular haematoma (1), extensive per umbilical haematoma (1) and haemorrhagic suffusions (2). As reported, additional risk factors for bleeding are: old age, chronic renal insuficiency, chronic hepatic disease, use of salicylates and systemic corticotherapy.The authors concluded that patients undergoing continuous LMWH therapy should be criteriously identified and monitorized to prevent complications"

Of the six cases, 4 were males and 2 females, with a mean age of 57 years. The most frequent symptom was abdominal pain and the most frequent sign was jaundice. Complaints lasted, on average, 1.6 months. Four patients confirmed recent ingestion of raw watercress. All had eosinophilia and altered liver function tests. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan suggested neoplasia in 3 patients, which made the diagnosis more difficult. The diagnosis was made on a positive parasitological examination of stool specimens. All patients had chronic fascioliasis. Five were treated with praziquantel; in 4 it was ineffective and they had to be re-treated, 2 with bithionol and 2 with dihydroemetine.

                    "Fabry-Anderson’s disease is a progressive X-linked recessive disorder. It is included in the group of at least 41 unique genetic lysosomal storage diseases.It is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to an accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids in most visceral tissues and fluids of the body which results in several clinical manifestations.Fabry-Anderson’s disease is characterized by acroparaesthesias, cutaneous angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, corneal opacities, and cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems disturbances. Deposition of neutral glycosphingolipids in cardiac cells implies varied disturbances, with several symptoms, depending on patient’s sex and age.Some individuals develop a cardiac variant of Fabry-Anderson’s disease. About 3 to 6% of asymptomatic men, with left ventricular hypertrophy, have the variant condition. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be used as a marker of disease severity. It is thought that 4 to 8% of patients with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy, considered as idiopathic, have Fabry-Anderson’s disease. This disease ought to be considered and investigated (through biochemical study or an endomyocardial-biopsy specimen) as a possible cause of a cardiomyopathy.Fabry-Anderson’s disease has a high morbidity and death occurs in early adulthood, by the fourth or fifth decades of life, due to vascular disease of the kidney, heart or brain."

                    "Essential hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction. This is caused by free oxygen radicals that destroy nitric oxide, impairing its protective effects on the vascular wall.The endothelium has an autocrine/paracrine function, regulating the secretion of substances that control vascular tonus and structure. It produces relaxing factors, such as Nitric oxide and prostacycline, as well as constricting ones such as endothelin.By definition, endothelial dysfunction is a reversible functional alteration of the endothelial cell, resulting from deficient availability of nitric oxide.In hypertensive patients, endothelial dysfunction, although not directly responsible for the elevation of blood pressure, is a promoter for the atherosclerotic lesion and the main complications of hypertensive disease and thus becomes a goal for antihypertensive therapy.So far, the evidence about the prognostic value of endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, is scarce. This makes it difficult to establish if pharmacological therapy of this entity represents an adjuvant beneficial effect beyond that of blood pressure control, namely on morbidity and mortality reduction in the hypertensive population."

Comparative analysis of the international literature in this field is referred. Data from 17 patients (9 females, 8 males; mean age: 62.4±16.8 years) with previous surgery and/or immobilization was reviewed. The majority of the patients presented non-massive PE (52.9%) associated with dyspnea (58.8%) and right ventricular dysfunction (52.9%). Laboratory findings: hypoxaemia (41.2%), elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (52.9%), d-dimers (35.5%) and fibrinogen (35.5%). Atrial tachycardia was observed on the electrocardiogram in 70.6% of patients. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dysfunction/dilatation in 9.4%. Imagiologic approach often shows a chest film with an enlarged right descending pulmonary artery (29.4%), perfusion lung scanning indicating a high probability of disease (47.1%) and spiral computed tomography with PE in the proximal pulmonary vascular tree (35.3%). All our patients were prescribed anticoagulant therapy. Two patients (11.8%) died."

Correct diagnosis and prognostic evaluation are amongst the mostimportant steps for successful management.Goals/ Methods: In this study 126 deaths in patients, in whom the main diagnosis was pneumonia, were characterized. The study period was from 1999 to 2001. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic and microbiological data was collected fromthe records in clinical files. The adequacy of twomethods of assessing prognosis was also evaluated as well as the quality of physician care.Statistics were handled using SSPS 11.0.Results and Discussion: The majority of patients were male and the mean age found was 77.6±11.0 years. The most important adverse prognostic features present in the patients were:respiratory rate>30/minute, admission diastolic blood pressure<60mmHg, mental confusion,acidaemia and urea and creatinine plasmaticlevels above 50 and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. Nopathogen was identified in 60% of the cases. Asignificant number of patients were categorised as having a bad prognosis by both methodsapplied, making them equally useful in the admission decision process. There was an agreement between the BTS and PORT scales. The initial approach lacked quality in the blood gasand aetiologic evaluation, in the delay in starting antibiotic therapy and in the low rates ofvaccination. The use of a pneumonia protocol is supported."

The liver biopsies performed in the Medicina 2 Services, from 1989 to 2001, were analysed. The procedure was identified in the Hospital data base using the code 50.11 (CID-9).There were 610 liver biopsies registered during the study period. Two populations were evaluated in greater detail. One comprising the cases from 1991/1992 (n=66) – group A -, comparing it with the second group from 2000/2001(n=106) – group B. Several clinical and laboratorial parameters were analyzed in 48 patientsin group A (72, 7 %) and 85 in group B (80, 2 %).From the results obtained, the authors pointout and comment on the significant rise in programmed liver biopsies compared to those performed in inpatients, in the most recent group(B) and a larger number of cases that were discharged the same day of the procedure. The adventof interventional radiology was also noted in thispaper; the performance of CAT scan guided liver biopsies in 12 % of the episodes in group B,as compared to none in group A. Where indications were respected, there were less procedures for diagnosis / staging of alcoholic liver disease and more to evaluate isolated altered liver enzymes, liver masses and control of pre andpost hepatic transplant. From the diagnosis established with the aid of this technique, the authors highlight the prevalence of non alcoholic steatohepatitis in the most recent group."

The diseasein humans is caused by only four of the sevenspecies of the bacteria: Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis and Brucella canis.Presently, its incidence is probably five times greater than the official figure, mostly due tomisdiagnosis of the milder forms and non-compliance with compulsory notification.Its geographic pattern coincides with the animal endemic distribution, being mostly an occupational disease, which involves mainly the 55-64 age-group, with a male predominance.The Brucella’ s pathogenic mechanisms are mostly due to its ability to survive in the intracellular environment, with smooth-lipopolyssacharide (LPL-S) having a fundamental role.Brucellosis is a systemic disease. Its presentation and the duration of the clinical pictureallow for its characterization in the acute, chronic and focalized forms.Wright’s sero-agglutination is the earliest means of serologic diagnosis in the acute form,with ELISA being the test of choice for diagnosing neurobrucellosis, chronic brucellosis andfor follow-up of active disease. Other serologictests appear as alternatives. The bacteriological culture of Brucella is frequently positive ifthe cultures remain in the appropriate mediumfor at least four weeks.Several treatment options are proposed, butthe association of doxicycline with streptomycin remains the most effective, with the lowest relapse rate."

                    "Microalbuminuria is at present considered an indicator of cardiovascular risk, often occurring associated with other cardiovascular risk factors and might be the renal marker for anincreased endothelial permeability that accompanies the atherogenic process. According tosome studies, the prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general population ranges from 3.8to 14.6%, being higher in diabetic and/or hypertensive individuals.Histopathological and experimental evidence suggest that dyslipidaemia can initiate andcontribute to the progression of nephropathy, with mechanisms similar to those involved inatherosclerosis; on the other hand, urinary albumin loss may lead to a rise in lipoprotein plasmatic levels.Lipid lowering therapy with statins has beenshown to reduce cardiovascular risk and also to improve endothelial function. Animal and invitro experiments have demonstrated beneficial effects of these drugs in several models ofnephropathy, including reductions in urinaryprotein excretion. Some studies conducted in patients with abnormal excretion of urinaryprotein support the hypothesis that reno-protective effects also occur in humans; however,the field is still open for investigation in thisarea, particularly the effect of statins in the reduction of microalbuminuria."

                    "Objectives and Methods: A retrospective study in patients with end-stage renal disease(ESRD) in haemodialysis, was carried out in our Internal Medicine Department. Our goalwas to analyse the reasons for hospital admission and the impact that these patients represent in terms of bed occupation.Results: During the 15 months’ timeframe 4.5% of the hospitalisations in the department were due to patients with ESRD, 49.7% of whom underwent haemodialysis. In the haemodialysedpatients 26.0% started haemodialysis during hospitalisation and in 19.2% there was loss ofvascular access. The studied group’s mortality rate (MR) was 23.3% (Department MR: 8.9%)and the average length of stay (LOS) was 16.4days (Department LOS: 9.8 days). In the patients with loss of vascular access, the MR was33.3% and LOS was 24.7 days. In those who started haemodialysis in hospital, the MR was 21.1%and the LOS was 23.4 days. Among the factors contributing to the increased length of stay weredelays in the programming, execution and revision of vascular access by medical and surgical sub-specialities. In 71.4% of patients with loss of vascular access the delay in the construction of vascular access was greater than aweek and in 57.1% this delay exceeded two weeks. In the patients with inaugural haemodialysis, these values were 64.3% and 28.6%.Conclusion: Patients with ESRD on haemodialysis impose a substantial load on Internal Medicine Departments. There are difficulties in the articulation with sub-specialities, with negative clinical and financial consequences. Thesefaults need correction, namely through the establishment of multidisciplinary approach protocols."

During infection andinflammation, a wide range of alterations in metabolism occur. These are part of the body´s reaction known as the acute phase response (APR). Infection and inflammation can also perturb lipoprotein metabolism and produce a widevariety of changes in the plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins.Eicosanoids are a group of oxygenated fattyacids with diverse and potent biological activity, produced from the fatty acids. The varietyof eicosanoids products and their correspondingly diverse physiological effects have been well characterized, and probably represent the best-understood relationship between lipids and biological function. Consequently, attempts tomodulate the production of eicosanoids musttarget either the enzyme activities responsible for synthesizing eicosanoids or the concentration of fatty acids substrate entering biological system through the diet."

Several second line therapies, includingimmunosuppression, have received attention in the international literature.We describe a case of a 36-year-old womanwith a 9-year history of ITP, refractory to corticosteroids and splenectomy, as well as to immunossupression with azathioprine for 2 years. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) wasused during the episodes of thrombocytopaenia with platelet levels below 10x109/L, with agood, yet transient response and an increasingnumber of hospital admissions (18 during 2 years). In view of the absence of a sustained response to the 1st and 2nd line therapeutic options and the transient response to IVIG, a 3rd lineregimen, described in the literature, of pulsedhigh doses of oral dexamethasone (40 mg/dayfor 4 days), with a 28 day interval, for 6 months, was started. After the last course and witha follow-up of 2 years, the platelet counts haveremained persistently above 100x109/L, without evidence of haemorrhage.This particular case provides additional evidence favouring the use of oral mega-doses ofdexamethasone as an effective and simple therapeutic option for refractory ITP, with favourable effects extended beyond the period of therapy."

Nevertheless, farmers whofail to follow safety precautions, may suffer accidental intoxication via the skin or respiratorytract. Poisoning in these cases is associated with a better prognosis.The A.A. describe the case of a 66-year old malewho sprayed his lower limbs with a paraquatsolution. Soon afterwards, he noticed erythematous macules, that over the period of a week,evolved to papules and ulcers in the legs anddorsum of the feet. Two months after paraquat exposure he developed macules, papules andhaemorrhagic bullae, some of which progressed to necrosis, in the digits of the hands andfeet, associated with fever and a general senseof being unwell. Histology revealed a small vessel necrotising vasculitis. There was a markedimprovement with steroid therapy and the patient is asymptomatic at 24-months follow-up.After exclusion of other causes of small vessel necrotizing vasculitis and even though it wasnot possible to determine the presence of paraquat in the affected skin, the temporal relationship with the direct exposure to the product allows for the hypothesis that this is a case ofhypersensitivity vasculitis caused by paraquat.A literature search failed to reveal a previous report of such an association."

The authors have retrospectively analyzed some post-discharge assessment parameters in an Internal Medicine Service.Material and Methods – Admissions to the Medicina II Service of the Coimbra University Hospital, who were discharged, as registered on the DRG data-base, , during a 3 month period were selected. Thepatients’ course inside the institution in the following 6 months was studied. Demographic data,outpatient visits, emergency visits and readmissions were analyzed, as were mortality, principaldiagnosis, DRG and its relative weight.Results – 72.9% of all patients had at least one post-discharge contact (outpatient visit, emergency visit, readmission). There were 232 outpatient visits (54.2% of patients), 100 emergency visits (41.6%) and 86 readmissions (41%); of the latter, the most frequent principal diagnosis was pneumonia (10,4%). The mortality rate was 10.4% (15 patients). Some factors influenced the results, like a relative weight over 1.0 and age under 80, which influenced the number of patients with outpatient visits, as well as thediagnosis of pneumonia, which influenced the number of patients with emergency visits and mortality.Conclusions – This study shows a significant impact of the post-discharge care in the same institution, in its diverse sectors. The in-hospital mortality was probably the most important result, revealing thegeneral prognosis of our inpatients. The systematic review of post-discharge assessment parameters,including in-hospital mortality and readmissions is important to overcome the difficulties in today’sInternal Medicine Services. It is necessary, in these studies, to use comparable methods, like DRGs and case-mix."

                    "Concepts about diagnosis of coeliac sprue have been changing in the past decade,namely recognising non-classical types of this disease, usually diagnosed in childhood. The development of serological tests with high specificity and sensitivity has lead to increased diagnosis of atypical or assymptomatic types, with consequent increase in incidence and prevalence of coeliac sprue.We report the case of a 25-year old woman admitted with general malaise, oedemas, 3-week long diarrhoea, recent childbirth with previous selective abortion of a twinpregnancy, intrauterine growth delay and oligoamnios. She had a previous medicalhistory of epilepsy since childhood, chronic anaemia in adolescence, and giardiasis.As an inpatient, the following tests were positive: D-xylosis for malabsorptionsyndrome, duodenal biopsy suggestive but not diagnostic for coeliac sprue.Autoantibody tests were positive for anti-gliadin IgA and IgG, anti-reticulin and antiendomysium.She clinically and histologically improved on a gluten-free diet. The autoantibody titre also diminished.A correlation is established between the obstetrical occurences and the circumstances in which the diagnosis was made.Coeliac sprue should be included in the work-up for diarrhoea in the adult, even in older ages. The diagnosis, once considered, is easy and cheap. It’s an example of newparadigms of Internal Medicine, as advances in laboratory diagnosis lead us toreappraise clinical reasoning, and reach new conclusions."

The association of multiple myeloma (MM) and AIDS has been controversial, and we have found only a few cases described to date.This association can be due to the co-infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), with the herpes virus 8 (HV8) or by chronic antigenic stimulation of the HIV infection.The A.A. present the case of a 65-year-old patient, with multiple bony lesions, monoclonal gammopathy IgG l and a bone marrow aspiration with 70% plasma cells. A diagnosis of MM in stage IIIa was made and the patient started doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone. He remained in complete remission after three cycles. The serology for HIV-1 was positive, presenting initially 220 CD4/ml and HIV-1 viral load of 29 084 copies/ml. He initiated antiretroviral therapy with AZT+3TC+indinavir. After four years of follow-up, the patient has no symptoms nor signs of relapse of the MM."

                    "Introduction and objectives – Haemorrhagic stroke is, in Portugal, unusuallyprevalent. Its diverse nature assumes equally diverse clinical presentations. The author’s objective was to characterise patients discharged, from the José Luciano CastroHospital - Anadia, with the diagnosis of haemorrhagic stroke, with respect to evolution and post-discharge planning.Patients and methodology – The clinical files of all patients admitted between 1994 and 1999 for subarachnoid and intracerebral haemorrhagic events, according to thediagnosis-related groups (DRG) database (ICD-9, codes 430 and 431) wereretrospectively reviewed. The following data was recorded: age, sex, residential area,mortality, hospital length of stay, co-morbidities, transferrals and post-discharge social planning. This data was compared and correlated to the data on ischaemic stroke for the same period.Results – There were 155 admissions for haemorrhagic stroke, corresponding to 148 patients. The population was homogeneous where residential area was concerned and accounted for 16.2% of all strokes. The average length of stay was 20.3 ± 14.1, longer in patients with infectious complications (28.3 ± 17.8 for pneumonia, 31.3 ± 12.8 for other infections) as well as for those with more than one comorbidity (32.0 ± 19.9). The prevalence of prolonged hospitalisation was 6.5%. Complications during hospitalisation occurred in 54.8% of the admissions, pneumonia being the most common complication registered (18 patients). The mortality rate was 18.1%, often early in the hospital stay (17.8% in the first day, 57.1% in the first six days) and mostly in the elderly. All these indicators were worse in comparison to those recorded for ischaemic stroke. On discharge social worker’s help was needed in 67.5% of cases.Discussion – The seriousness of haemorrhagic stroke, obvious from the indicatorsconsidered (mortality, average length of stay, transferral and comorbidities) is greater than that of other strokes, and it affects younger populations. The need for post-discharge social planning in a large number of patients is also discussed. The significant weight of these indicators and the increased hospital resources expenditure in thesecases, raises the question as to whether reimbursement should be the same as that for ischaemic stroke events, as all stroke pathology is coded similarly (DRG 14) “Specific cerebrovascular disorders, except TIA”"

He had a history of pleuropulmonary tuberculosis when he was 12-years-old, from which chest wall sequelae resulted and he had multiple hospital admissions with pulmonary infections. He was admitted for study, and chest x-rays (CXR) showed the presence of chest-wall lesions and a right pleural effusion. Laboratory analysis of the pleural aspirate revealed an empyema. Upper digestive endoscopy showed a fistula, with drainage of purulent liquid. CXR and thoracic CT scan with oral contrast documented the passage of contrast from the oesophagus into the pleural space, confirming the existence of a oesophago-pleural fistula. The patient underwent oesophageal exclusion surgery, with drainage and decortication of the right pleural space. Two months later oesophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction was performed. Two years after surgery a relapse of the empyema occurred, and thoracoplasty was necessary. To date there have been no subsequent problems."

It can mimic or coexist with many other autoimmune organ-specific, haematological, or neurological disorders.These are some of the reasons why despite its relatively high prevalence, SS is often underdiagnosed, and some call it an “orphan disease”.The authors review clinical, immunological, histophatological aspects and therapeuticoptions of the disease."

In 16 centres, 208 ambulatorypatients, 18-70 years old, were selected and classifiedaccording to the levels of risk defined by theguidelines of the European Atherosclerosis Societyvalid at the study time.

Total cholesterolwas reduced by 25.2%, LDL cholesterol by 32.2%,and triglycerides by 23.3% (p<0.001). In 17% of thepatients it was necessary to double the dose ofatorvastatin, in order to try to achieve the cholesterolgoals of the respective cardiovascular risk level, andcomparing to V3 levels, total cholesterol decreasedmore 10.0% and the LDL cholesterol more 13.3%.With the 10 mg dose, HDL cholesterol increased by35% (p=0.013) in patients with a basal level under35 mg/dl (n=14), and by 15% (p<0.001) in all patientswith a basal level under 40 mg/dl (n=37).This study, in Portuguese dyslipidaemic patients,confirmed the excellent efficacy and tolerability ofatorvastatin in decreasing LDL cholesterol levelsand in increasing low HDL cholesterol levels."

As a response to hypernatraemia, the brain undergoes a series of mechanisms to avoid neuronal shrinkage. The rapid up-take of electrolytes is followed by a slower phase of accumulation of organic osmolytes. Hypernatraemia is treated with infusion of liquids at a rate dictated by the rate of removal of the referred solutes from the brain. The mortality rate varies between 40 and 60%."

                    "ystemic sclerosis is a relatively rare disease, characterized by variable degrees of fibrosis within the skin and internal organs. There are two major subsets, limited and diffuse systemic sclerosis, which are differentiated primarily by the extent of skin involvement, and are characterized by different disease evolution and prognosis. Concepts regarding this disease have changed over the years. Uniform concepts are extremely important, as they will allow comparison of groups of patients from different centres, and therefore facilitate a better knowledge of this disease.Although systemic sclerosis was first described in the 18th century and is recognized as a multi-systemic disease since the 19th century (before, cutaneous sclerosis – scleroderma – was considered as one disease and other diseases, such as gastrointestinal, pulmonary, etc., were considered to be associated with it), its’ aetiology remains unknown and its’ pathogenesis not entirely understood. This has resulted in the non-existence of a specific and therefore curative treatment. Despite this, advances have been made regarding the treatment of several of the disease manifestations. The discovery that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for instance are effective in the treatment of sclero-derma renal crisis, the most fatal complication of systemic sclerosis up till then. Such new advances have allowed improvement in the quality of life and the rate of survival of these patients. In this article, the new perspectives of treatment of this disease and its’ different aspects are discussed."

                    "Fascioliasis is a parasitic disease that usually affects herbivores. Human infestation occurs through the ingestion of contaminated water or plants. The authors describe four patients from the Republic of Cabo Verde, who presented with prolonged fever, weight loss, tender hepatomegaly, anaemia, hypereosinophilia, an erytrocyte sedimentation rate over 100, low albumin, hypergammaglobulinemia, high alkaline phosphatase and high gama-GT. Fasciola sp. eggs were found in the faeces together with positive serology. Abdominal CT scans revealed hepatomegaly with multiple focal liver lesions not enhanced by contrast and in one of the cases described as “tracking” lesions. The patients were treated with triclabendazole, approved only for veterinary use, but already successfully used in humans without side effects in Europe and Latin America.This treatment was well tolerated and resulted in a good clinical, laboratory and radiological response. The authors propose that triclabendazole should be the treatment of choice in hepatic fascioliasis especially in the light of the known therapeutic failures and multiple side-effects associated with the use of bithionol, emetine, albendazole and praziquantel, the recommended treatment to date of fascioliasis."

It is important that all doctors responsible for the initial approach of stroke patients are able to recognise early CT signs of acute ischaemic stroke.Ischaemia results in changes in cerebral tissue density which are present on a CT scan taken during the first 4 hours after a stroke. This has been demonstrated in animal and human studies.Ischaemic oedema, the hyper-dense artery sign and cerebral oedema are early CT signs, that are potentially visible in the first hours after ischaemic stroke. Each of this signs has its own meaning and implications, which can help decide whether a patient is eligible or not for fibrinolysis.Images of each of the above mentioned signs are presented."

He also showed reduced effort tolerance, distended jugular vein pressure and ankle oedema. All the symptoms disappeared within 3 months. The patient was followed for two years with no subsequent re-appearance of symptoms. The authors conclude that the patient had post­ pericardiotomy syndrome with the serositis being worsened by a haemorrhagic component due to iatrogenic hypocoagulability.

As well as the clinicai picture of epigastric burning, cramping abdominal pain and vomiting the patient had an eosinophilic ascitis and eosinophilia was present on the full blood count. There was no history of allergy. Endoscopic and Japaroscopic biopsies revealed intense eosinophilic infiltration involving both serosa] and muscular layers and a mild eosinophilic in.iltration of the intestinal mucosa. There was no evidence of intestinal parasitosis. A short course of oral steroids was started and there was an impressive improvement of symptoms and resolution of ascites within a week. This case shows (1) a rare disease, (2) a non-surgical cause of acute abdominal pain of obscure origin, (3) the chronicity and relapsing character of the disease, and (4) the efficacy of short course steroids. We review the literature focusing on new aspects of eosinophil pathogenesis and the interface with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome."

Methe­ moglobinemia causes tissue hypoxia, being responsible for chocolate colour type of cyanosis, and other progressive symptoms, including abnormalities of respiratory and cardiac function as the concentration of methemoglobin grow up.",

The most common genetic cause is deficiency of enzymatic system of cytochrome-b5 reductase, from which we know three differentgenetic variations with weak activity.",

If there is deficiency of the referred enzyme, the haemolytic action of methylene blue will happen with lower doses of the drug. Exchange transfusions are alternative therapy in serious cases.

In this article we aimed to study thenatural history of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the different therapeutic approaches and the referencestrategies after discharge. In order to do so, aretrospective study was performed and 81 in-patientswith the diagnosis (primary or secondary) of alcoholwithdrawal syndrome were studied. The most frequentcomplications encountered were rhabdomyolysis (51%)and seizures (39%). The drugs most often usedtherapeutically were neuroleptics and benzodiazepines.After discharge, there was no patient referral or follow-up in half of the cases. We concluded that alcoholwithdrawal syndrome is a frequent diagnosis and thereis a need for the implementation of therapeuticprotocols and better follow-up after discharge, if wewant to change the natural history of this disease."

                    "Aims: To study the presentation, treatment andevolution of Paraquat poisoning, looking forprognostic indicators.Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis ofParaquat poisoning cases admitted to an InternalMedicine department between January 1987 andJanuary 2000, using a data collection protocol, wasmade. The following parameters were assessed:demographic; quantity ingested and time fromingestion to hospital arrival; evolution and mortality;clinical manifestations and results of laboratorial testson and during admission; treatments instituted.Results: 37 cases were documented: 19 died(51.4%) after a mean time of 7 days, 18 survived(48,6%) after a mean follow up of 7.5 months. Theappearance of jaundice, leucocytosis, renal failureand hypoxaemia was significantly more frequent inthe patients who died. High values of lacticdehydrogenase and low values of carbon dioxideon admission were associated with worse prognosis.Among the various treatment modalities used,sodium sulphate, either isolated or associated withgastric lavage and activated charcoal, had astatistically significant favourable effect on survival(used in 31% of the deceased and 55% of survivors).Haemocarboperfusion was used more frequently inthe group of deceased patients (58% against 33%).Other dialysis techniques were used infrequently.Conclusions: The best prognostic indicator(paraquatemia) was not available in our series.Mortality correlates with the quantity of poisoningested, resulting acutely from multi-organ failure,or from late respiratory failure. Adsorbents andcathartics are still the only confirmed prognosticmodifiers. Advantages of other therapeutic modalities, such as dialytic techniques, were notfound in this study."

In general, the former is an acutecomplication (acute tubular necrosis andglomerulonephritis), while malariae infection can beassociated with a chronic progressive syndrome(nephrotic syndrome with evolution to chronic renal failure).It appears that acute renal failure (ARF) infalciparum malariae cases is not directly caused bythe parasite itself, but is the result of interaction ofmechanical, immunological, and humoralcomponents. Risk factors for the development ofrenal failure include hyper-parasitaemia, shock andsevere intravascular haemolysis. Delayed treatmentof malaria and late or inadequate correction ofvolume depletion, are probable contributing factorsin some cases. The reversibility of the renal lesionhas been well shown, by the reduction in mortalityachieved by introducing peritoneal or hemodialysis,as well as following the parenteral administration ofquinine. In severe cases associated with “black waterfever” a fatal outcome is almost inevitable.A mild acute glomerulonephrits has beendocumented in many patients with acute falciparum malaria.The nephrotic syndrome may develop in patients,particularly children with repeated plasmodiummalariae infections. It seems that this entity resultsfrom chronic deposition of immune complexes in the kidney."

Examplesof daily problems related to patient clinical notes inthe Emergency Service and at the time of HospitalAdmission are reported and suggestions are made for their resolution"

Improvement was seen followingadherence to a gluten-free diet.In May 98 the patient presented with sudden onsetof fever. Oligoarthritis and erythema nodosumdeveloped; bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy wasfound, symptoms and signs typical of acutesarcoidosis – Löfgren syndrome. The diagnosis wassupported by bronchoalveolar lavage and lymphnode histology. Other systemic disorders with asimilar presentation were excluded.Several autoimmune diseases have been associated with coeliac disease, such as thyroid disorders,Addison’s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, IgAnephropathy and insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus. The association between sarcoidosis andcoeliac disease has been rarely described in theliterature (only ten cases to date).The immunological mechanisms, accepted asresponsible for this association, are discussed"

There are several associated conditions:fluid losses, oedematous states (heart failure, hepaticcirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), syndrome ofinappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion(SIADH), primary polydipsia and endocrinediseases. Initial evaluations to reach an aetiologicdiagnosis should include: measurement of plasmaticand urinary osmolality, the plasma concentration ofsodium, and clinical assessment of the extracellularcompartment. Two basic principles are involved inthe treatment of hyponatraemia: raising plasmasodium concentration at a safe rate and treating theunderlying cause. However, treatment of thisdisorder also requires balancing the risks ofhypotonicity against those of therapy, in order toavoid central osmotic demyelination. A new class ofpromising agents, the vasopressin receptorantagonists, has been described, and it seemsreasonable to expect improvement in the treatmentof hyponatraemia associated with heart failure,hepatic cirrhosis and SIADH.This article focuses on the causes, differentialdiagnosis and treatment of this electrolyte disorder."

A definition, historicalperspective, organisation, vocation and formation,with reference to the different realities in the USA(where these problems have been much discussed)and Portugal, including several well-known expertcitations, is made. The dichotomy between GeneralInternal Medicine and its Sub – Specialities, as wellas the relation between the General Internist andthe Specialist is elaborated. Special emphasis is givento the priority need of future investment in PrimaryCare and in the formation of Generalists (Internists,Paediatricians and Family Physicians who are inshort supply in our country) on which,unquestionably, our Health System must be based.Also attention is drawn to the undesirable numberof General Physicians without suitable formationand institutional employment. A plan to differenciateInternal Medicine as a Medical Speciality, basedon a common period of 3 years, is presented andjustified. The division of General Internal Medicineinto three different but complementary fields issuggested: Primary Care Internist, HospitalSpecialist and Emergency Specialist, adapting therecognised American and German models. The finalconclusions emphasise the need to face theseproblems with determination and coherence, puttingpatients suffering and the way Health System works,as our top priority."

We reportthe clinical case of a 68-year-old woman, who wasadmitted to the hospital because of an acuteconfusional state, in whom initial clinical investigation revealed severe hypercalcemia. Confusion persisted after correction of the calcium levels and a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism wassubsequently established on detection of elevatedlevels of serum parathyroid hormone. The patientunderwent parathyroidectomy with a progressiveremission of the neuropsychiatric manifestations.This case illustrates an extremely rare presentingform of primary hyperparathyroidism, consisting inan acute confusional syndrome that persisted aftercorrection of hypercalcemia and that remitted onlyafter surgical treatment of the disease.

It is defined as an increase, in the first 12-24 hours, in serum aminotransferase activity, at least 10 times above the upper limit of normal, followed by resolution to near normal leveis within the first 10 days.",

                    "The maximum leveis and day of resolution were assessed for the following items: Alanine amino­ transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, prothrombin ratio and creatinine.",
                    "Results and Conclusions",
                    "Over a period of 5 years and 3 months, 40 patients with ischaemic hepatitis were identified - prevalence 2,8% - 23 males, 17 females, and mean age 64,9 years.",
                    "Ischaemic Hepatitis was associated with high values of both illness severity scoring systems (APACHE II and SAPS I) and therapeutic in­ tervention scoring system (TISS). Both decreased perfusion and hypoxia caused a rapid elevation of aminotransferases and lactic dehydrogenase; the former correlated with a reduced prothrombin ratio.",
                    "Prothrombin ratio was the only parameter which correlated with mortality."

                    "Aims: Study of the prevalence and clinicai significance of HGV infection in carriers of HBV or HCV, in patients with chronic hepatitis of unknown aetiology, and in those belonging to some risk groups. Patients and methods: HGV-RNA was determined in serum of 118 patients (75 M, 43 F): 18 with chronic hepatitis C (group I); 17 alcoholics with anti-HCV (group II); 36 chronic haemodialysis patients (group III), 16 of them with chronic hepatitis C (IIIA) and 20 without anti-HCV or HBsAg (IIIB); 17 renal transplant recipients with HCV infection (group IV); 18 chronic hepatitis B patients (group V); 10 with chronic hepatitis with unknown aetiology (group VI); 2 women with autoimmune hepatitis.). Eleven patients {7 of group I and 4 of group II) were drug addicts. HGV-RNA was assessed by RT-PCR, with primers of the 5'NC and NS5a regions, labelled with digoxigenine. Liver histology was assesssed and correlated with HGV infection in 56 chronic hepatitis C patients and in those belonging to groups V, VI and VII.",
                    "Results: We found HGV-RNA in 20 patients: 3/18 (16.7%); 2/17 (11.8%) of group II; 5/36 (13.9%) of group III, 2/16 (12.5%) of IIIA and 3/20 (15%) of IIIB; 6/17 (35.3%) of the group IV; 4/11 drug addicts (36.4%); none of the patients with cryptogenic or autoimmune hepatitis. Liver histopathology in 9 patients HCV + HGV infections showed minimal activity in 4 and mild in 5; no fibrosis in 3, portal in 6; in 4 HBV +HGV, mild activity and no fibrosis in 1, severe activity and bridging fibrosis in 3 (also alcoholics). The 3 haemodialysed with only HGV infection had normal ALT and GGT.",
                    "Conclusions: The prevalence of HGV infection was quite similar in most of the studied groups (12.5 to 22%); the exceptions were drug addicts (36.4%), renal transplant patients (35,3%) and those with chronic non-BC hepatitis (0%). Our data suggest little or no pathogenicity of HGV. However, the severity of liver disease in alcoholics with HGV and HBV infections is a remarkable finding. Future studies on the relationship between this and other hepatitis vírus are warranted."

                    "ln conclusion, the more feasible and useful prevention measures suggested here in are: to minimize the time of hospitalization of the elder; to avoid aggressive procedures; and to restrain the use of psychoactive compounds."

It aims to assess the nutritional status of patients aged 65 years or older, admitted to the general me­dical ward of a Central Hospital.",
                    "Methodology: The triceps skinfold thickness (TST) and mid­arm circumference were measured using the standard manner and the midarm muscle cir­cumference (MAMC) calculated using the re­ commended formula. The TST or the MAMC were considered diminished when below the 10th percentile of the reference table, matched for age and sex. The albumin, transferrin, pre-al­bumin, retinol binding protein, haemoglobin, total number of lymphocytes and total cholesterol were also measured and compared to the hospital's laboratory reference values.",
                    "Results: The percentage of undernourished patients, in accordance with the previously defined parameters, revealed a wide range of values, varying from 11,1 to 35,6 %, with respect to each of the anthropometric values measure · andfrom 30,6 to 88,6 % with respect to each of the laboratoty values.",
                    "Discussion andconclusion: There is no single anthropometric measure­ ment or laboratory parameter, that is, in iso­lation, a good indicator of the nutritional status in an individual patient. There is a large disparity between the information given by each variable in relation to the nutritional status of an individual pattent. ln the elderly, bedri­dden pattent, who often has a serious inter­ current illness that leads to hospitalisation, there is an urgent needfor the development of a nutritional índex which could be used in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, there is a gre­at need for large-scale anthropometric studi­es in bealthy adults, in particular in the elderly population, in Portugal the correct iden­tification of under-nutrition in individual ca­ses and groups of patients needs to be made."

Secondly, the authors' present low molecular weight hepa­rins, which combine easy administration with easy monitorisation, making their total cost lower than that of unfractionated heparin. Caution must be exercised in their implemen­tation, as each low molecular weight heparin has an individual profile that must be asses­sed in each clinical situation.

The carcinogenic potential of UR is experimentally confirmed. Other kinds of radiation, chemical substances and viruses could also be implica­ted in the aetiopathogenesis. These associati­ons are not yet fully understood. There does not seem to exista sole mechanism which cau­ses a normally diffterentiated keratinocyte to transform into a malignant cell, with the po­ tentialfor local invasion and distant metastases. The way this change occurs still remains almost unknown."

                    "The future role of Internal Medicine must defi­ne itself more clearly in order to enable us to provide an appropriate post-graduate educati­on. The General Internist inherited role as mas­ter diagnosttcian-consultant has been largely usurped by technical advances. ln the last years, some policies have been implemented aimed at training General Internists as Primary Care Specialists, and thus artificially restricting thetr clinical activities. These were the two major rea­sons for the decreasing number of General In­ternists and an increasing number of Sub-speci­ality Internists. Another important point is that Internal Medicine doesn't give sufficient outpa­tient experience during the undergraduate me­dical training period, which is a wonderful oppor­tunity to experience the value of Internal Medi­cine as a career of choice. ln the United States, health care evolved into a largely Specialist/Sub­ specialist system and now proves to be more expensive while the outcomes are not clearly bet­ter. The author presents some ideas that he be­ lieves would increase the attractiveness of Ge­neral Internal Medicine."

                    "Evidence-based Medicine(EBM) combines the expertise of the individual clinician with the best external evidence from clinical research into a rational ethical and efficacious practice. EBM constitutes a new paradigm for medical practi­ce, in the sense that it tries to transform clinical problems into well formulated clinical questions, selecting and critically appraising the scientific evidence available using predefined strictrigo­rous criteria. Modem medical practice is an ever­ changing process, and the needs of the doctors for information have been partially met by con­tinuous medical education activities, which have been shown not to stop the well-known fact that clinical knowledge, as well as medical practice, deteriorates with time. The busy clinician has two major problems whenfaced with the need to get the most recent and relevant information possi­ble: most of the published medical literature is either irrelevant or not useful and he/she has scarce time left for reading it. EBM can be thou­ght and practiced by physicians with different degrees of autonomy, with several subspecialti­es, working in the hospital or in outpatient cli­nics, alone or in groups."

                    "A 4-year study (1990-93), including all patients consecutively admitted with a diagnosis of com­ munity-acquired pneumonia selected by retros­ pective review ofthe Hospital da Horta records, was performed. Clinical analytical and demogra­phic data, avaliable on admission and recorded in the medical records, were analyzed. Using lo­ gistic regressions the prognostic factors from medical data recorded on admission that sho­ wed a univariate association with mortality were analyzed.",
                    "Eighty-eight patients were included in the stu­dy, representing 4 percent of all admissions in the Department of Internal Medicine. Three ca­ses per 1.000 habitants were admitted in 1990, and this ratio decreased to 1,5 /1.000 habitants in 1993. The mean age was 64 +17 (r(lflge: 20-92); 41% were males and 59% werefemales. Se­ven patients (8 per cent) died because of respi­ ratory failure or sepsis. The prognostic factors associated with mortality were: chronic ethanol intake, kucocytes >15 x109/L,glucose > 6,8mmol/ L, urea nitrogen >7,2 mmol/L, creatinine >110 mmol/L, LDH >350 U/L, AST >40 U/L, pH <7,30, PaO2 < 7,33 kPa and PaCO2 >6 kPa. ln the multi­ variant analysis elevation in PaCO2 and LDH, remained significant."

                    "Nailfold capillaroscopy is a non-invasive me­thod for in vivo observation of micro - circulati­on. Several studies have been presented showing the relationship between capillary morphology and the presence of auto-immune diseases. Others, addressed the relationship between specific cha­ racteristics found in essential hypertension, di­abetes and duration of disease. Nevertheless,few quantitative controlled studies have been perfor­med.",
                    "The authors present a case control study in a population of women with diagnosed auto-im­mune diseases and a population of healthy con­trols.",
                    "Twenty consecutive women from the Out-pati­ents Clinic of the Auto-immune Diseases Unit, were considered (9 patients with systemic lupus erythe­ matosis (SLE), 7 with systemics sclerosis (SS) and 4 with other auto-immune diseases). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or primary vascular disease were excluded. A po­pulation of 20 healthy, age and sex matched controls was recruited among the hospital staff. Nail­fold capillaroscopy was performed with a video stereomicroscope, and quantitative measurements were evaluated with the use of a metric scale included in the ocular system. The observations were performed in the sarne room, with a stabi­lised temperature. For each patient and control, measurements were made regarding capillary density and diameter, and the presence ofminor or major structural changes. The fagrell index was used to access the global micro-vascular damage.",
                    "Statistical significance was found with capi­llary density (p<0.003), diameter (p<0.009), and the presence of minor (p<0.001) and major (p<0.002) structural changes, between patients and controls. The fagrell index was also signifl­cantly different ( p< 001). Lupus and systemic sclerosis patients were compared and differen­ces were found regarding major structural chan­ges (p<0.02) and the Fagrell index (p<0.01), with higher values for SS patients.",
                    "The control group was compared with the SLE patients and the presence of minor structural changes was found more frequently in the Lu­pus group (p<0.0001 ). The other parameters eva­luaded showed no significant difference. The SS patients showed differences regarding the capi­ llary density (p< 0.0001) and diameter (p<0.0001) as well as the presence of major structural chan­ges ( p<0.01).",
                    "The results highlight the importance of nail­ fold capillaroscopy in the evaluation of patients with auto-immune diseases. The differencesfound are consistent with the micro-vascular involve­ ment in these diseases. The diferent patternfound in SS and in SLE patients, can be explained by the different pachophysiology of these diseases. Fagrell classification canbe an important index to evaluate the severity and evolution of the pa­thological ftndings."

Recurrent episodes of oral ulceration is the presenting mani­festation in 78% of cases. Ocular involvement is the most disabling complication, being observed in 74% of cases. Of these, 80% present with bilateral involve­ment, with permanent sequelae in 52%. Cutaneous findings are observed in 82%, with pseudofolliculitis found in 62% of the total. Genital apthae were obser­ved in 80% of cases. A positive pathergy test was dis­played in 40%. Joint disturbances, not a diagnostic criterion, was the flrst clinical finding in 7% of all ca­ses. As a whole, 85% of patients showed some joint involvement. The clinical diagnosis of BDis late (7,0 ± 7,5 years), but there is an inevitable delay in diagno­sis of 4,0 ± 4,7years (range: 0-21), dueto the need to obtain and associate the necessary diagnostic crite­ria. Recurrent oral ulceration is afrequent flnding in family members of BD patients, being observed in 42% of first and second degree relatives. HIA B5 is found positive in 60% of cases, deflning a relative risk of 5. ln all B5 positive cases, in whom B51 was tested,100%, had a positive result."

Registers of nutritional support provided are inadequate, though ente­ral or parenteral regimens are regarded with greater care. Polimeric diets are adequate; a semi­ elemental diet is seldom necessary. The protocol was appropriate but there is a need for close supervision regarding proficiency of care. A new protocol with an individualized registry sheet and guidelines for nutritional needs is proposed."

We analysed: age and sex; types of CVD and temporal profile; VRF (previous AVC, hypertension (HT), diabetes, dyslipidemia, heart disease, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption); morbility and morta­ lity; blood pressure (BP), complete blood count, glucose and lipid analysis at admission.",
                    "Patients: 65 patients were young adults (YA) and 309 were old (Od).",
                    "Results: The CVD in YA represented 14% and in Od 66.7% of ali CVD admitted; male were more prevalent in YA (52.3%) and female in Od (58.3%). The most frequent type of CVD was ischemic (IS) (82.8% in YA and 82.1% in Od) with the lacunar sub-type more prevalent in YA (P-0.04) and the atherothrombotic in Od (P=0.004); TIA represen­ ted 8.3% of IS in YA and 3.3% in Od Previous stroke were reported in 20% YA and 32.7% Od (P=0.04). The dyslipidemia (43.1%), heavy alchool con­ sumption (24.6%) and cigarette smoking (12.3%) were more preval,ent in YA. There was heart dise­ase in 36.9% YA and 52.4% Od (P=0.02); the valvu­lar cardio-pathy was more prevalent in YA (18.5%). Infeccious complications were observed in 32.1% YA and 58.3% Od (P=0.001). The YA ha­ved a good improvement (slight deficits in 56.8% YA vs 28.3% Od - P=0.001). The mortality rate in YA was 12.3% and in Od 30.4% (P=0.003).",
                    "Conclusions: The preval,ence of CVD in YA was 14 %. We observed more prevalence of female in olders. The IS was the more frequent stroke in both groups, the lacunar sub-type was more fre­quent in YA and the atherothrombotic in Od The HT was the more frequent VRF in both groups. The valvular cardiopathy was more frequent in YA and atrial fibrillation in Od The morbility and mortality was higher in older patients. ln admis­sion the mean level of dyastolic BP, total choleste­rol, LDL-C and triglycerides were significantly higher in YA."

                    "The authors present a retrospective analysis of HIV infected patients treated in an Internai Medi­cine Ward, from January 1992 to June 1995. The following parameters were analysed: number of admissions per patient, time of permanence in the hospital, opportunistic complications, final outcome, medical counselling at leaving and dis­tribution according to sex, age, ethnic, infectious virus, risk group and staging.",
                    "From the results one can highlight the following: 61 patients were admitted, with a total of 134 ad­missions: 20 in 1992, 35 in 1993, 60 in 1994 and 19 during the first semester of 1995. 57% of the pati­ents were drugs addicts and the most frequent opportunistic infection was tuberculosis. Of the 202 opportunistic complications observed, we could reach an accurate diagnosis in 47,6% of the cases. The average time of permanence in the hos­pital was 15,8 days. Mortality was 10% and 94% of the patients were sent to the outpatient clinic of Infectious Diseases. The authors tried to ma­tch the results with the social and economical si­tuation, comparing them with other national ca­suisty.",
                    "The authors conclusion is that the HIV infecti­on is more and more an important reason of ad­mission, even in District Hospitals and in Inter­nal Medicine Wards."

The quantities of poi­son ingested were variable, but more frequently between 20 and 100 ml Thirteen in-patients were death while the other 13 were discharged from hospital with good health (known middle survi­ val time of 10 months). The 2 groups were com­ pared and the single prognostic factor was the ingested quantity of paraquat. Dyspnea, oliguria and jaundice were the clinical manifestations with prognostic value, while values of LDH, AST and pO2 (at admission on Urgency Room) were also prognostic indicators.

They have studied the number of ca­ses, its distribution by age and sex groups, rele­vant clinical data for diagnosis mentioned in the admission notes, prevalence of coexistent disea­ses, smoking, radiologic localization, other com­plementary tests (chest x-ray, sputum cultures, broncofibroscopy), most used antibiotic therapy and its changes, clinical outcome, average duration of stay, mortality and global results.",
                    "Pneumonia was a frequent cause of admission (9,3%), mainly male patients (63,2%), and affec­ted females were older. Fever (67,2%) and cough (52,7%) were the clinical data most commonly found Sputum cultures were positive in 18,2% and blood cultures in 13,6%. The right lung (39,3%) and the inferior lobes were more commonly affected Heart failure (24,8%), diabetes mellitus (21,1%), COPD (20,2%), chronic alchoolism (14,7%) are the most commun associated diseases. Smokers ac­ count for 17,2% of studied cases. Beta-lactamic antibiotics alone or associated to amicacin, or erithromycin were the therapeutic choice in most cases. Global results were good with 85,2% of im­ provement or cure, and average time of stay was 12,9 days."

Its manifestations are: fluctuation of the state of awareness, disturbance of the sleep­ awake cyde, deficit of attention and concentrati­on, disorganized thought that originates incohe­rent speech, disturbances of perception like illu­sions and/or hallucinations, disorientation in time and space, agitation or reduced psychomo­tor activity and disturbed memory. The major causes of delirium in the /CU are: systemic and metabolic diseases, for instance sepsis, renal fai­lure and hepatic failure; exogenous toxic agents, e.g. some drugs; withdrawal from substances upon which the patient has become dependent, like alcohol; and primary intracranial diseases such as infections of the central nervous system. Other factors often coexist like sleep deprivati­on, previous cognitive deficits, fear, anxiety and the patient's personality. Treatment comprises the correction of metabolic and systemic disturban­ces, the suspension of toxics and/or the use of antidotes, the withdrawal treatment, the use of haloperidol and benzodiazepines, and non-phar­ macological actions that reduce the environmen­tal stress and promote the physical and mental well-being."

To mathematize Medicine is attempting but faces great limitations. Statistics, the branch of mathematics more closely linked to medical activities, is very useful to define trends. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that statistical antecipations will in fact happen, in a indi­vidual case.",

Clinical decision must consider statistical data, among several other sour­ces of information. However, the global sense of the doctor will never be replaced by the myth of an abstract and unexpressive list of figures. A diag­nostic procedure, a therapeutic approach, the dis­closure of the prognosis are always personal choi­ces.

According to the Author, the physician should recover the role as an advisor. ln the future as it is easily predicta­ble, besides the physician's responsability towar­ds he patient, he will also be more responsable for the cost-benefit ratio of medical care within the society.

From the obtained results they underline: A) The therapi­ es used were: hydratation only (n = 27) and associ­ ated with drugs (n = 18), include always furosemi­de), {corticoids ( n = 6), calcitonin ( n = 9), bisphos­ phonates (n = 12)}. B) ln the 10 patients with se­ rious hypercalcemia (:::,_ 13 mgldl) all made thera­ peutic associations, while only 6 ofthe 29 with sli­ght hypercalcemia (:::,_ 10,4 - 11,5 mgldl) used them ln the patients with serious symptoms (n = 14) at­ tributed to hypercalcemia, only 7 made associati­ ons beyond hydration. ln the patients with documented bone metastization ( n = 15) predominated the use of calcitonin or bisphosphonates. C) The regression of the symptomatology was more consi­derable in the group that used bisphosphonates. ln the patients subjected to the therapy, there was temporary control of calcemia, more relevant with various drugs in association. ln a third of the pati­ents that used bisphosphonates or calcitonin there was an ease of pain. D) The death rate in hospitali­zation and delay was about twice more than the total of the hospitalized patients.",

The autors also point out that Sfreptococcos Pneumoniae was the most commun agent isolated, as reported in the bibliography.

The decrease of blood pressure has proved to reduce the hypertensive ( mechanical) complications of hypertension but it did not prevent myocardial infarction, an atheros­ clerotic complication, as expected by the results of the epidemiological studies. ln addition, it is not clear the real effect of antihypertensive therapy in the prevention of ischemic cerebrovascular acci­dents. Both situations are the result of thrombotic events and are straightly related to endothelial function, platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic system and coagulation.",

They are highly active against Enterobacteriaceae and also active against some strains of Pseudo­monas aeruginosa and Staphilococcus sp., howe­ver recent reports indicate increasing resistance. They have poor activity against streptococci and anaerobes. These agents exhibited excelknt oral absorption, good tissue distribution and are excreted primarily by way of the kidney. The inci­dence of adverse effects to fluoroquinolones appe­ars to be low. The most common are gastrointesti­ nal reactions, followed by central nervous system disorders. Hypersensivity reactions occur occa­sionally. Fluoroquinolones interact with a number of other agents, with potential clinicai manifesta­tions, such as antacids, theophylline, warf arine. The bioavailability after oral administration allows the use of these agents without loss of effi­cacity, when compared with IV administration, thus reducing substantially the treatment cost."

From our experience, gravity scores such as APACHE II, SAPS I or TISS although useful in this pathology, are not totally effective in predicting a fatal ou­tcome. With the purpose of improving the predictive power of those scores, we conducted a retrospective study of 143 patients admitted at U.U.M.. Using appropriate statistical methods, two gravity scores were built: the first one used 16 items obtained at admittance to the ICU, and the second one was based upon 13 clinical and therapeutic items obtained during the time spent at the ICU. Patients were stratified in three risk groups according to the individual score result (Scorel <19 - mortality: 4%, Scorel between 19 and 33 - mortality: 30%; Score1 >33 - mortality: 94%). Two groups of high prognostic value for a fatal outcome ( sensitivity: 93% and specificity: 87%) were defined by the use ofthe second score. Score2 (Score2 <14 - mortality: 4%; Score2 >= 14 mortality: 78%). The use of both scores (1 and 2) revealed a more accurate predictive power of a fatal outcome than APACHE II, SAPS I or TISS. Score2 strengthened the predictive power of Sco­rd, mainly on those patients with intermediate risk prognosis at admission. Using Scores 1 and 2 altogether, we found a predictive result of ou­tcome in 89% of all patients."
