It was dramatic at the time, but now it’s just one of those stories we laugh about and will always remember. </p>

                    <p> Milan... well, let's just say it wasn’t exactly my favorite destination. Honestly, unless you’re super into high-end shopping (and have the wallet to match!), there’s not much to do. I didn’t find the city to be particularly special, and I honestly don’t think I’d go back. I didn’t have many photos either because, well, there wasn’t much to capture! Milan just didn’t leave a big impression on me. </p>

                    <p> Stockholm was an incredible city to explore, but I have to admit, it was so cold! The winter chill really made me appreciate the cozy cafes and warm indoor spots. </p>
                    <p> The cold didn’t stop me from enjoying the beauty of the city, though, and I ended up falling in love with its calm and peaceful atmosphere. Walking through Gamla Stan (the Old Town) felt like stepping into a fairy tale, with its cobbled streets and colorful buildings. One of the most amazing things I found in Stockholm was the art in the metro stations! The walls are decorated with colorful murals making every ride a unique visual experience. </p>
                    <p> That said, I have to be honest - everything is so expensive! From food to transport, it definitely made me rethink my budget, but the experiences and beauty of the city were totally worth it. </p>
